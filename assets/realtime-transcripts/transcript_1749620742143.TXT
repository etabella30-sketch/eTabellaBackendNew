 2 09:22:549.45 am)

 3 09:45:20                       Housekeeping

 4 09:45:22HE PRESIDENT:  It's quarter to, now.  I call everybody to

 5 09:45:22   order.

 6 09:45:23       This is the fourth day of the evidential hearing in

 7 09:45:26   Strabag International GmbH against the Republic of

 8 09:45:29   Uganda.  There's a number of pieces of housekeeping,

 9 09:45:34   which I'll raise this morning.

10 09:45:37       The first is we have overnight received an exchange

11 09:45:41   with the parties, the presentations from the delay

12 09:45:45   experts.  We're very grateful to both parties for having

13 09:45:48   given them to us before time so that we could have

14 09:45:50   a look at them and study them.

15 09:45:59       So we have those and thank you very much.

16 09:46:01       The second point is we've obviously seen by emails

17 09:46:05   last night the parties' desire to have the quantum

18 09:46:08   experts dealt with on Monday.  The tribunal is perfectly

19 09:46:10   relaxed about that and happy with that as long as both

20 09:46:13   parties are confident we will get through them on

21 09:46:15   Monday.  Are both parties confident about that?

22 09:46:18R GILLION:  Absolutely, sir.

23 09:46:20R KIWANUKA:  Absolutely.

24 09:46:21HE PRESIDENT:  Then that is what we shall do.  So thank you

25 09:46:23   very much for that.


                                       1






 1 09:46:27       We've also received details of the parties'

 2 09:46:33   agreement in relation to when they will exchange closing

 3 09:46:36   submissions.  Just to check, the parties have agreed

 4 09:46:39   there will be one round of closing submissions, no reply

 5 09:46:43   submissions; is that right?

 6 09:46:46R GILLION:  That's correct, sir.

 7 09:46:47R KIWANUKA:  That's correct.

 8 09:46:47HE PRESIDENT:  The tribunal will liaise to come up with

 9 09:46:49   some dates following the exchange of submissions at the

10 09:46:52   end of July and then cost submissions at the start

11 09:46:56   of August, as I read the email.  Dates for a half-day

12 09:47:00   oral hearing to be dealt with remotely.

13 09:47:03R GILLION:  Just on that, I don't know if there was any

14 09:47:05   confusion yesterday when we proposed post-hearing steps,

15 09:47:09   it's not the parties' position that we should have oral

16 09:47:12   submission.  It's only really if the tribunal were to

17 09:47:15   find it of benefit that the parties are available for

18 09:47:18   you to answer any questions.

19 09:47:20HE PRESIDENT:  I understand that and the tribunal

20 09:47:21   understands that.  I think the tribunal all think it is

21 09:47:24   very likely to be of benefit.

22 09:47:27       There are obviously two ways of arranging that.  We

23 09:47:29   can wait until we see the submissions and then confirm

24 09:47:32   that, or we could give you dates now and put it in the

25 09:47:35   diary and then vacate it if we receive the submissions


                                       2






 1 09:47:38   and we've no questions.

 2 09:47:39       I think our preference would be the latter, to have

 3 09:47:41   it in the diary, simply because if we wait until the end

 4 09:47:45   of July and then say we need it, people's diaries may

 5 09:47:52   not allow that for some months.

 6 09:47:53       So the tribunal will liaise and come up with a set

 7 09:47:56   of dates probably over the weekend and let you know on

 8 09:47:58   Monday and then you can all look at your diaries and

 9 09:48:01   work out which of those dates suits, in a mutual way.

10 09:48:06       The last point of housekeeping I think before the

11 09:48:08   witness comes in, which is why I've asked the gentleman

12 09:48:10   to wait outside; can the tribunal just understand in

13 09:48:15   broad terms where we are with the issue that arose

14 09:48:18   yesterday?  Mr Gillion, would you like to go first?

15 09:48:21R GILLION:  It would be better for the respondent to

16 09:48:23   explain how -- but I can summarise my --

17 09:48:26HE PRESIDENT:  Well, tell me your position, then we'll turn

18 09:48:28   to the respondent, and then if we need to hear further

19 09:48:32   from you, we will.

20 09:48:33R GILLION:  I understand that the version of

21 09:48:35   Mr Ocirowijok's witness statement that was introduced to

22 09:48:39   him at the beginning of his cross-examination, which was

23 09:48:41   marked, as you remember, R-11 on the cover --

24 09:48:46HE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

25 09:48:47R GILLION:  -- is in fact, despite being signed by him,


                                       3






 1 09:48:50   an earlier version, a draft version of his witness

 2 09:48:52   statement, which was later filed in the arbitration and

 3 09:48:55   which became part of the hearing bundle with the

 4 09:48:59   reference RWS-7.

 5 09:49:03       So we've reviewed this earlier version of his

 6 09:49:06   witness statement and we do not consider that the

 7 09:49:08   differences which appear between the two versions, when

 8 09:49:12   we've done the compare, would affect the evidence he

 9 09:49:17   gave yesterday.

10 09:49:18HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

11 09:49:18R GILLION:  So on that basis, we would be prepared to

12 09:49:21   continue and finish with his cross-examination this

13 09:49:25   morning --

14 09:49:26HE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

15 09:49:26R GILLION:  -- on the basis of what is the final version,

16 09:49:30   the signed version, of his witness statement, which is

17 09:49:34   marked RWS-7, which has been filed in this arbitration

18 09:49:37   and which is in the hearing bundle.

19 09:49:39HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

20 09:49:40R GILLION:  Obviously before we do that, we obviously need

21 09:49:42   to be satisfied that our understanding is correct, that

22 09:49:47   RWS-7 is indeed the final version of his witness

23 09:49:51   statement, so -- and that the content of his witness

24 09:49:54   statement obviously reflects to the best of his

25 09:49:58   knowledge that the facts are correct, because he's been


                                       4






 1 09:50:00   cross-examined on the basis of this witness statement.

 2 09:50:02   So that there's no confusion, he needs to confirm that

 3 09:50:05   the answers he gave were on the basis of this witness

 4 09:50:08   statement marked RWS-7.

 5 09:50:10HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  So as I understand it, RWS-7 is

 6 09:50:13   the version that is in our trial bundles and the version

 7 09:50:16   that was shown on the screen yesterday?

 8 09:50:17R GILLION:  That's correct.

 9 09:50:18HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Can I turn to you, Attorney General.

10 09:50:21   You've heard what the claimant has said about that.

11 09:50:23   What would you like to say about this?

12 09:50:26R KIWANUKA:  Well, thank you very much, Mr President and

13 09:50:28   honourable members.  Yes, we've discussed this with

14 09:50:31   Mr Gillion and the position as he communicated is the

15 09:50:35   correct position.  The final version of the witness

16 09:50:37   statement is RWS-7, which is in the trial bundle, which

17 09:50:41   is what was displayed on the screen.

18 09:50:45       Obviously we agree that definitely the witness must,

19 09:50:48   if he's to be cross-examined on that, confirm that the

20 09:50:51   contents of that RWS-7 is a true reflection of his

21 09:50:58   evidence.

22 09:51:01HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  So as matters stand, RWS-7, I don't

23 09:51:11   think this witness has confirmed as true and accurate,

24 09:51:16   because what he was asked about was the version I'm

25 09:51:18   going to call R-11, which was the version that was on


                                       5






 1 09:51:27   his table yesterday whenever he was asked about this,

 2 09:51:29   and we saw him turn to the signature and check it and

 3 09:51:33   say that was the information he was given.

 4 09:51:35       Does it follow from that, Attorney General, that

 5 09:51:37   what you would like to do is to put RWS-7 to him this

 6 09:51:40   morning and get him to confirm that that is his evidence

 7 09:51:43   as well?

 8 09:51:44R KIWANUKA:  That's correct, Mr President.

 9 09:51:45HE PRESIDENT:  And I understand, Mr Gillion, you have no

10 09:51:47   objection to that, from what you've just told me?

11 09:51:50R GILLION:  That's correct, sir.

12 09:51:51HE PRESIDENT:  And in terms of R-11, that will also remain

13 09:51:54   his evidence, because that is what he said yesterday,

14 09:51:57   but, Mr Gillion, you take the view that you do not need

15 09:52:01   to go back over in any forensic detail the differences

16 09:52:05   between the two documents, at least in

17 09:52:07   cross-examination; is that right?

18 09:52:09R GILLION:  That's correct.

19 09:52:09HE PRESIDENT:  That obviously leaves you free to make

20 09:52:11   whatever submissions you want about this in due course,

21 09:52:13   but just for me working out what's happening this

22 09:52:16   morning, you're going to finish your cross-examination

23 09:52:18   of this witness after he puts into evidence RWS-7?

24 09:52:23R GILLION:  That's correct.

25 09:52:24HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Fine.  Does anybody on either side


                                       6






 1 09:52:28   wish to say anything more about this before I bring the

 2 09:52:30   witness in?

 3 09:52:31R KIWANUKA:  Not on our side.

 4 09:52:32R GILLION:  No.

 5 09:52:33HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, both of you, that's

 6 09:52:35   very clear.  Anything from my fellow arbitrators?  No.

 7 09:52:39   Can we have the witness back in, please.

 8 09:52:41             MR BRIAN OCIROWIJOK (continued)

 9 09:53:17HE PRESIDENT:  Is there a paper copy that the witness can

10 09:53:19   have of the RWS-7?  Can that be handed to the witness,

11 09:53:26   please?

12 09:53:29       Morning, sir.  Can I just remind you before you

13 09:53:31   start giving evidence that yesterday you read out a form

14 09:53:34   of words affirming that you would tell the truth and

15 09:53:39   nothing but the truth.  Do you remember that yesterday?

16 09:53:41.  Yes.

17 09:53:42HE PRESIDENT:  Your evidence is still subject to that

18 09:53:44   affirmation.  We don't have to do it again; the one you

19 09:53:47   gave yesterday counts in terms of this morning as well,

20 09:53:51   okay?

21 09:53:52.  Yes.

22 09:53:53HE PRESIDENT:  Yesterday when we finished there was

23 09:53:54   a confusion about two different statements that had been

24 09:53:56   produced that you had signed.

25 09:53:58.  Yes.


                                       7






 1 09:53:59HE PRESIDENT:  The parties have discussed this and what I'm

 2 09:54:04   interested in is whether you are also able to confirm

 3 09:54:08   the truth of the second statement.  Yesterday you had

 4 09:54:11   a statement marked R-11 that you confirmed the truth of.

 5 09:54:14.  Yes.

 6 09:54:15HE PRESIDENT:  This morning, a second statement has been

 7 09:54:17   put before you, which is in the bound document in front

 8 09:54:21   of you.  Can I ask you, please, to turn through that

 9 09:54:26   statement.  Is that statement signed as well?

10 09:54:34.  Yes.

11 09:54:36HE PRESIDENT:  Did you read that statement as well before

12 09:54:37   you signed it?

13 09:54:38.  Yes.

14 09:54:39HE PRESIDENT:  Are the contents of that statement as well

15 09:54:43   true to the best of your knowledge and belief?

16 09:54:44.  Yes.

17 09:54:46HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  If you wait there,

18 09:54:48   there will be a few more questions for you from

19 09:54:50   Mr Gillion and then possibly some re-examination.

20 09:54:53       Mr Gillion.

21 09:54:54       Cross-examination by MR GILLION (continued)

22 09:54:58R GILLION:  Good morning.

23 09:54:58.  Good morning.

24 09:54:59.  We're going to start -- or finish this cross-examination

25 09:55:01   where we left it yesterday.  I would like you to look at


                                       8






 1 09:55:07   paragraph 37 of your witness statement, which we will

 2 09:55:10   see on screen in a second.  Can you see paragraph 37?

 3 09:55:14   It starts with:

 4 09:55:14       "I note that Mr Patemann states that the unforeseen

 5 09:55:18   rock fill was also slowing down the earth works due to

 6 09:55:21   the use of the same equipment."

 7 09:55:23HE PRESIDENT:  Just because of the confusion, you've said

 8 09:55:25   paragraph 37 of the witness statement.  We're talking

 9 09:55:27   about the witness statement RWS-7 that, sir, you have

10 09:55:32   just confirmed to be true.

11 09:55:33.  Yes.

12 09:55:36R GILLION:  That's the same paragraph we showed you

13 09:55:37   yesterday on screen, and then we dealt with the first

14 09:55:41   point, which is:

15 09:55:44       "This is false because firstly as demonstrated

16 09:55:46   above, the equipment is not necessarily the same."

17 09:55:48       What I would to ask you is about the second part of

18 09:55:51   your response, which says:

19 09:55:52       "Secondly, rock fill was not necessarily

20 09:55:57   an antecedent activity to G7 fill because not everywhere

21 09:56:01   G7 fill was placed required rock fill to be placed."

22 09:56:06       So am I correct to understand that what you're

23 09:56:08   saying here is that in some areas, rock fill was not

24 09:56:14   required and that therefore in those areas rock fill is

25 09:56:18   of course not an antecedent activity?


                                       9






 1 09:56:21.  Yes.

 2 09:56:23.  So in locations where rock fill is to be placed, then

 3 09:56:28   rock fill is an antecedent activity because you place G7

 4 09:56:33   first and then you place rock fill on top of the G7; is

 5 09:56:36   that correct?

 6 09:56:37.  Yes.

 7 09:56:39.  Just for again my understanding, in order to place rock

 8 09:56:42   fill, you excavate and then you put rock fill in it and

 9 09:56:46   then G7; is that the correct order?

10 09:56:51.  You cut to spoil, you rock fill, you sand bind, or you

11 09:56:57   bind it, thereafter you put the G7.

12 09:57:00.  Okay, so cut to spoil is an excavation, right?

13 09:57:04.  Yes.

14 09:57:04.  Then rock fill and G7, fine.  So assuming you have to do

15 09:57:09   this, cut to spoil, do you need at least to have the

16 09:57:15   same pace of cut to spoil, of excavation, before you put

17 09:57:21   rock fill?  You can't just suddenly have a high rate of

18 09:57:23   rock fill but no place to put it because it has not been

19 09:57:26   excavated; is that correct?

20 09:57:28.  After all, the specification says that when you're

21 09:57:30   planning your works, you have to make sure that you spot

22 09:57:33   out the problematic areas first and deal them ahead of

23 09:57:36   time, such that now when you come to do your G7, you

24 09:57:40   will not have any problem with rock fill.  So your rock

25 09:57:42   fill was supposed to be done probably some three, four,


                                      10






 1 09:57:46   five months; you start with your rock fill activities or

 2 09:57:48   your swampy areas in the dry season.  Thereafter you now

 3 09:57:51   start now doing your G7.  Beside that, all these

 4 09:57:53   activities don't affect your G7.

 5 09:57:54.  So it will make sense to have these instructions to

 6 09:57:58   place rock fill in particular areas before you then

 7 09:58:01   consider the planning of your excavation?

 8 09:58:03.  Yes, which I believe was given in February 2021.

 9 09:58:07.  All the instructions for all the rock fill of this

10 09:58:10   project?

11 09:58:11.  Ideally there were preliminary instructions that were

12 09:58:14   supposed to be done.

13 09:58:24R GILLION:  Sir, I'm going to leave it here, unless you

14 09:58:26   want to elaborate on what you mean by "preliminary

15 09:58:30   instructions"?

16 09:58:32.  There were instructions supposed to be done, there were

17 09:58:35   instructions.  I believe every instruction that is given

18 09:58:38   is supposed to be done.  So, it was instructed, it was

19 09:58:41   supposed to be done.

20 09:58:43.  So there was some instructions in February 2021 for all

21 09:58:46   the locations on this site?  All the locations, how many

22 09:58:53   cubic metres of rock fill was instructed in February

23 09:58:55   2021?

24 09:58:56.  I don't have the memory of the quantities.

25 09:58:59.  How much quantity of rock fill was placed on this


                                      11






 1 09:59:02   project at the end of December 2024?

 2 09:59:05.  Of course now what I believe is that this is

 3 09:59:08   an admeasurement contract.  Whatever instructed is an

 4 09:59:13   estimate.  Just like everything else, you only instruct

 5 09:59:15   based on estimates, but what is actually paid for is

 6 09:59:18   what is actually done and measured.  That is -- we only

 7 09:59:22   pay for the actual quantities.  So we don't pay for the

 8 09:59:25   instructions, we pay for the actual quantities.

 9 09:59:26.  My question is, how much quantity of rock fill was

10 09:59:28   placed on this project at the end of the project?

11 09:59:31.  I don't know the exact quantity because it has not been

12 09:59:35   confirmed.

13 09:59:42.  So you're saying that a contractor, given some

14 09:59:44   instructions to place rock fill in February 2021, would

15 09:59:50   be able to plan ahead his work for excavation because he

16 09:59:54   would know in which areas he would need to place rock

17 09:59:56   fill?

18 09:59:57.  Exactly, of which I'm sure the problem was they had no

19 10:00:00   quarry.  And that's what I put in my statement, I'm

20 10:00:05   sure -- (overspeaking) --

21 10:00:05.  If you've been told to place let's say 8,000 cubic

22 10:00:09   metres of rock fill 21 and you end up placing 100,000

23 10:00:15   cubic metres of rock fill at the end of this project,

24 10:00:18   surely you can't plan in the same way.  Would you agree?

25 10:00:21.  I believe the instruction was more than 8,000.


                                      12






 1 10:00:25.  How much?

 2 10:00:27.  I don't exactly know, but it was more than 8,000.

 3 10:00:32.  Can you remind me, what was the instruction of the

 4 10:00:37   quantity of rock fill which resulted from the design --

 5 10:00:40   the December 2021 redesign by SR in December 2021?

 6 10:00:47.  I don't know why you ask me figures.  That I didn't

 7 10:00:51   instruct myself.  These are figures that the SR

 8 10:00:53   instructed.  I'm sure there are others who can best

 9 10:00:57   explain that.

10 10:00:58.  You certainly are suggesting that the contractor could

11 10:01:00   have planned all the rock fill ahead of time in --

12 10:01:04.  Exactly.

13 10:01:04.  -- in February 2021?

14 10:01:06.  Yes.

15 10:01:07.  But you're not able to tell me how much rock fill was

16 10:01:10   instructed in February 2021?

17 10:01:12.  Because that was SR instructed.

18 10:01:15.  But despite that you can actually just assert that the

19 10:01:18   contractor could have planned all his excavation

20 10:01:20   activities because he knew exactly where to place rock

21 10:01:21   fill so it could -- (overspeaking) --

22 10:01:22.  Exactly.

23 10:01:23.  Without supporting your evidence with any figures?

24 10:01:28.  Ideally planning -- the SR instructed figures which I am

25 10:01:31   not sure of the exact figures right now, but those


                                      13






 1 10:01:34   figures, whatever the SR had instructed, they were

 2 10:01:37   supposed to plan for it and execute.

 3 10:01:39.  Would it be fair to say that if -- let's assume -- I'm

 4 10:01:45   not given the instruction that you say we received for

 5 10:01:48   100,000 cubic metres in February 2021, if we didn't

 6 10:01:51   receive this instruction, we didn't know where to place

 7 10:01:54   the rock fill, would you agree that on that basis you

 8 10:01:56   would need to have areas excavated before you place rock

 9 10:02:01   fill?

10 10:02:04.  I don't know why you are taking us an assumption that

11 10:02:07   you already have -- you already have evidence that the

12 10:02:10   areas that the SR wanted you to do the rock fill already

13 10:02:12   instructed.  There's no need for us to assume.

14 10:02:17.  My question is a simple one.  You did actually explain

15 10:02:20   to us yesterday you were not involved in the calculation

16 10:02:22   of productivity but from an engineer's point of view,

17 10:02:24   you could actually prepare this witness statement

18 10:02:27   asserting that the contractor should have received that

19 10:02:31   productivity which was 1,624 cubic metres per day for

20 10:02:37   rock fill, for example?  Is that what you said?

21 10:02:39.  I said that the SR's productivity is reasonable, based

22 10:02:42   on my own assessment.

23 10:02:44.  Your assessment as simply an engineer?

24 10:02:48.  It's not my only assessment.  Everyone else has

25 10:02:51   assessed.  The SR -- the supervisor as well has


                                      14






 1 10:02:54   assessed.  Any purposes, you have been in the

 2 10:02:57   arbitration, we have seen, everyone else has assessed,

 3 10:02:59   experts have all assessed, and everything is consistent.

 4 10:02:59.  But yet not involving a calculation of this production

 5 10:03:03   rate, we established that yesterday.

 6 10:03:04.  I was not involved in the IPC -- I mean in the PoIT,

 7 10:03:12   some of those revs; some of those revs I was not

 8 10:03:16   involved in any of those assessments.

 9 10:03:17.  So the rock fill rate 1,624, you were not involved in --

10 10:03:18.  No, no, I was not involved.

11 10:03:19.  Fine.  Let's assume that's the rate that has been

12 10:03:23   selected at some point in time.

13 10:03:25.  Yes.

14 10:03:25.  Would you agree that if a contractor was to achieved

15 10:03:28   that productivity rate of 1,624 cubic metres per day, he

16 10:03:33   would need, to be able to place the rock fill at that

17 10:03:36   pace, areas which are excavated, he can actually place

18 10:03:40   the rock fill?  Would you agree with that?

19 10:03:44.  I don't get --

20 10:03:44.  By "excavation", it's cut to spoil.

21 10:03:44.  Yes.

22 10:03:44.  You would need to have space where you place the rock

23 10:03:49   fill?

24 10:03:50.  Yes.

25 10:03:52.  So you would -- and that, we established when we


                                      15






 1 10:03:54   discussed this morning, that requires cut to spoil, rock

 2 10:03:58   fill, G7 fill.  That's the order?

 3 10:04:00.  Yes.  You cut to spoil where needed, because some places

 4 10:04:05   you don't need to cut to spoil.

 5 10:04:07.  In most areas of the site, was cut to spoil required

 6 10:04:11   before placing rock fill?  The quantities are on the

 7 10:04:16   record, so, you were there on site, you should remember

 8 10:04:16   that?

 9 10:04:17.  Yes, but -- yes, but I think most areas, cut to spoil

10 10:04:20   was required.

11 10:04:21.  So we established that, so cut to spoil is required.

12 10:04:24   You place rock fill.

13 10:04:26.  Yes.

14 10:04:27.  If cut to spoil has not been executed, then you can't

15 10:04:31   place rock fill?  In most areas of the site?

16 10:04:36.  Yes, yes.

17 10:04:37.  So let's assume that you have a particular rate for

18 10:04:39   executing cut to spoil.

19 10:04:41.  Yes.

20 10:04:42.  Let's say 545 cubic metres per day.

21 10:04:46.  Yes.

22 10:04:48.  If you have a higher rate of placement of rock fill,

23 10:04:51   let's say 624 cubic metres per day.

24 10:04:56.  Yes.

25 10:04:56.  You wouldn't be able to achieve that rate because you


                                      16






 1 10:04:58   would be stuck, you wouldn't be able to place your rock

 2 10:05:02   fill because it hasn't been cut to spoil.  Is that

 3 10:05:04   correct?

 4 10:05:04.  First of all, you should understand that rock fill, rock

 5 10:05:07   fill is not supposed to be done every day.  So you don't

 6 10:05:12   need to do rock fill when actually you don't need to do

 7 10:05:16   it, because (inaudible) -- it's not supposed to be done

 8 10:05:19   everyday, means that now you only plan to execute it

 9 10:05:22   when you need to execute it.  If not, your productivity

10 10:05:25   rate of rock fill is high.  You first have to make sure

11 10:05:26   that whatever is supposed to be done before, that has a

12 10:05:27   lower productivity rate, is done ahead of time so that

13 10:05:32   now when you're doing your rock fill, you just come and

14 10:05:34   fill the available space at the appropriate rate, so

15 10:05:36   that you save your equipment time.

16 10:05:39.  If you have 100,000 or so cubic metres of rock fill to

17 10:05:46   be executed --

18 10:05:47.  Yes.

19 10:05:47.  -- this would certainly require some resources planned

20 10:05:52   ahead to be able to execute that much quantity.  It's

21 10:05:57   not simply on this project a little bit of rock fill now

22 10:06:00   and then.  Certainly for phase two, as we saw at the

23 10:06:02   beginning of our opening statement, it was a lot of rock

24 10:06:05   fill pretty much everywhere; is that correct?

25 10:06:07.  Actually, the rock fill was about 7 kilometres out of


                                      17






 1 10:06:10   the 66, which is 10% of the whole road.  I believe 10%

 2 10:06:14   of the whole road is not so much to affect your

 3 10:06:16   programme.

 4 10:06:19.  Well, I won't bother to go back to the opening statement

 5 10:06:22   where we actually identified the location, but as

 6 10:06:25   a principle, would you agree that without cut to spoil

 7 10:06:29   executed, you can't place rock fill, that we've

 8 10:06:33   established that?

 9 10:06:33.  Yes, I believe you cannot do that so --

10 10:06:34.  So if the rate --

11 10:06:34.  So that's why you have to plan your cut to spoil way

12 10:06:38   ahead of time if you know that your productivity rate is

13 10:06:40   low.  Or alternatively you can add more gangs so that

14 10:06:43   you have more cut to spoil done at a much faster rate

15 10:06:43   than your rock fill side, you are able to create enough

16 10:06:46   voids for it to fill.

17 10:06:50       So it's a matter of programming, it's not even a

18 10:06:51   matter of engineering.  It's programming.

19 10:06:53.  Okay, so providing you don't know where to place rock

20 10:06:56   fill, this would affect how you can plan?

21 10:06:58.  But you would have the locations.

22 10:07:01.  It's just a question.  If you don't know where to place

23 10:07:04   rock fill, would it affect your programme?  Your ability

24 10:07:06   to plan the works?

25 10:07:07.  We don't go into --


                                      18






 1 10:07:09.  It's just a "yes" or "no", sir.

 2 10:07:10.  -- assumptions.

 3 10:07:10.  It's a question.  If you don't know the location of

 4 10:07:13   where you're going to place rock fill, would you be able

 5 10:07:15   to plan the works?

 6 10:07:16.  If we never knew, we would not.  But in this case, we

 7 10:07:19   know.

 8 10:07:21.  "We" being?

 9 10:07:23.  Everyone knew, because the first thing is that the swamp

10 10:07:26   locations were already in series 7000, the special

11 10:07:30   specification, and you know, the treatment for swamps,

12 10:07:32   for permanent swamps, is always rock fill.

13 10:07:35.  We've established with other witnesses that these areas

14 10:07:38   first of all do not actually give you the exact

15 10:07:38   location --

16 10:07:40.  Of course not, they are all approximate.

17 10:07:41.  -- nor the -- and you need -- would you agree you do

18 10:07:43   need an instruction before placing rock fill?

19 10:07:44.  Exactly.

20 10:07:46R GILLION:  I'm going to stop here, sir.  No further

21 10:07:49   questions.

22 10:07:54HE PRESIDENT:  Any re-examination?

23 10:07:56              Re-examination by MR KIWANUKA

24 10:08:00R KIWANUKA:  Yes.

25 10:08:01       Engineer Brian, you were asked about paragraph 37 of


                                      19






 1 10:08:04   your statement.  Just one question.  Regarding the --

 2 10:08:08   could you go to paragraph 37.  You were asked about the

 3 10:08:12   order of placement of materials.  What sits on there, is

 4 10:08:17   it G7 or rock fill?  Could you explain and clarify on

 5 10:08:21   what comes first, the layers?

 6 10:08:26.  Of course for the layers, where you need to do rock

 7 10:08:27   fill, the rock fill has to come first.  But in this

 8 10:08:31   case, like already I have mentioned, we have measured

 9 10:08:34   rock fill areas.  The rock fill was just 7 out of 77 --

10 10:08:36   out of 67 kilometres, which is just 10%, of the what?

11 10:08:42   Of the whole road.  10% of the whole road is actually

12 10:08:46   very easy for you to plan, and --

13 10:08:47.  What is placed after the rock fill?

14 10:08:48.  So what is placed after the rock fill is the what?  You

15 10:08:53   can have the -- of course the G7 is placed after rock

16 10:08:57   fill but there's another layer in between there.

17 10:09:02R KIWANUKA:  That is all.

18 10:09:06                Questions by THE TRIBUNAL

19 10:09:07HE PRESIDENT:  I have one or two questions arising out of

20 10:09:09   what was said this morning.  I don't know if it's

21 10:09:12   possible to put the [draft] transcript up on the screen

22 10:09:14   so the witness can see it.  Is that possible?  The

23 10:09:18   transcript of today?

24 10:09:37       Whilst that's being pulled up, I'll just read out

25 10:09:40   what you said this morning and then I want to ask you


                                      20






 1 10:09:44   what you meant.

 2 10:09:48       Mr Gillion was asking you the following question.

 3 10:09:51.  Yes.

 4 10:09:53HE PRESIDENT:  I'm sorry, I have it at [draft] page 10,

 5 10:09:59   line 10.  At line 12 Mr Gillion asked you this question.

 6 10:10:07   He said: [page 10, line 17]

 7 10:10:08       "You can't just suddenly have a high rate of rock

 8 10:10:11   fill but no place to put it because it has not been

 9 10:10:14   excavated; is that correct?"

10 10:10:16       And you, sir, said:

11 10:10:18       "After ... the specification says that when you're

12 10:10:22   planning your works, you have to make sure that you spot

13 10:10:26   out the problematic areas first and deal them ahead of

14 10:10:31   [simultaneous] such that now when you come to do your

15 10:10:35   G7, you will not have any problem with rock fill."

16 10:10:38       Okay?  So I had understood you to be saying that the

17 10:10:43   specification says when you're planning your works, you

18 10:10:47   have to make sure you spot out the problematic areas

19 10:10:50   first and deal them ahead of time.

20 10:10:53.  Yes.

21 10:10:54HE PRESIDENT:  Whenever you used the word "'you' have to

22 10:10:58   make sure you spot out the problematic areas first", who

23 10:11:01   is the "you" you are referring to?  Is it the

24 10:11:07   contracting authority?  Is it the contractor?  Is it

25 10:11:10   somebody else?  Is it both?


                                      21






 1 10:11:14.  For execution it is the contractor.

 2 10:11:25HE PRESIDENT:  Sorry, do you say it is the contractor?

 3 10:11:27.  Yes, for execution it is the contractor.  Of course the

 4 10:11:30   other parties have their own interests in knowing them

 5 10:11:32   first, but for execution purposes, the contractor has to

 6 10:11:35   spot out those areas, or he has to look at the evidence

 7 10:11:38   of the areas that he has maybe on his table or in his

 8 10:11:41   design or anything, and he deals with them first in his

 9 10:11:44   execution.

10 10:11:46HE PRESIDENT:  Why do you say that's for the contractor to

11 10:11:48   do?

12 10:11:48.  Because ideally these are -- these swamp areas here,

13 10:11:51   when you deal with them last, it will affect your work,

14 10:11:55   it will affect your progress of work, because most of

15 10:11:57   the swamp areas there, when you try to construct those

16 10:12:00   areas there in the rainy season, you literally have no

17 10:12:04   work, because the moment you maybe try to, let me say,

18 10:12:07   excavate, it rains and water fills the area.  So when

19 10:12:10   the place is flooding, how do you now build work?  You

20 10:12:13   won't be able to do anything.  You'll have to wait for

21 10:12:15   the floods to first maybe subside and then after, you

22 10:12:18   come back and work.

23 10:12:19       So that's why they said: no, you spot out those

24 10:12:21   areas there in the dry season.  Which I believe the

25 10:12:23   specification already gave them an idea.


                                      22






 1 10:12:26HE PRESIDENT:  Just stop there.  Again you say:

 2 10:12:27       "[Now we say] you spot out those areas ... in the

 3 10:12:31   dry season."

 4 10:12:32       Who is the "you" in the phrase "you spot out those

 5 10:12:35   areas"?  Is it the contracting authority, the

 6 10:12:38   contractor, somebody else?

 7 10:12:40.  The contractor.

 8 10:12:41HE PRESIDENT:  Why do you say that's the contractor's job

 9 10:12:43   and not the contracting authority's job?

10 10:12:46.  The contracting authority already spotted out in their

11 10:12:50   special specification.  They already gave them an idea,

12 10:12:55   which they said: this is an estimate.  So the contractor

13 10:12:58   still has a role to make sure he confirms that those are

14 10:13:01   actually true, because that road is always going to

15 10:13:03   establish the work.  As well of course, whenever he

16 10:13:05   confirms the area, the SR as well has to confirm that

17 10:13:10   these are actually true.

18 10:13:12HE PRESIDENT:  So let me ask you about that, because some

19 10:13:17   of the evidence which we have seen suggests that

20 10:13:21   regardless of who should have done it -- and leave that

21 10:13:25   to one side, that's a contractual argument -- in fact

22 10:13:28   what happened was that the contracting authority spotted

23 10:13:34   the areas during the works and issued instructions to

24 10:13:37   put rock fill in those areas.

25 10:13:40.  Yes.


                                      23






 1 10:13:40HE PRESIDENT:  So it looks like the contracting authority,

 2 10:13:42   during the works, identified areas for rock fill and

 3 10:13:49   gave instructions that rock fill be presented there.  Am

 4 10:13:52   I right that that's what happened?

 5 10:13:54.  Yes.

 6 10:13:55HE PRESIDENT:  So, given what you've said, why was the

 7 10:13:59   contracting authority doing that, and not the contractor

 8 10:14:03   saying: we think we need to put rock fill in these

 9 10:14:06   areas?

10 10:14:09.  I cannot answer why the contracting authority did that.

11 10:14:13HE PRESIDENT:  But we've seen nothing to suggest that the

12 10:14:17   contracting authority was saying anything like: you, the

13 10:14:22   contractor, should be doing this but you're not, so we

14 10:14:24   have to do it.

15 10:14:26       Do you know what happened on site where the

16 10:14:30   contracting authority ends up doing the spotting and the

17 10:14:33   instructing about this?

18 10:14:34.  From my idea, or from what I think -- now this is just

19 10:14:42   a thought -- from what I think, the contractor, from the

20 10:14:48   word go, has been running away from their obligations.

21 10:14:51   So --

22 10:14:56HE PRESIDENT:  So -- sorry, go ahead.

23 10:14:58.  They have always been blaming everybody else for

24 10:15:01   whatever they feel is not going on well, except

25 10:15:03   themselves.  So that's what I think.


                                      24






 1 10:15:04HE PRESIDENT:  I don't want to speculate about this.  Are

 2 10:15:06   you aware, factually, of any letter or any communication

 3 10:15:15   where the contracting authority is saying something

 4 10:15:17   like: you, the contractor, should be doing this, but

 5 10:15:21   you're running away from your obligations so now we're

 6 10:15:24   going to do it.

 7 10:15:26       Are you aware of any letter or meeting in which that

 8 10:15:28   happened?

 9 10:15:33.  For discussions, there were a lot of discussions in that

10 10:15:35   regard.  But as for letters and communications, I cannot

11 10:15:38   confirm.

12 10:15:40HE PRESIDENT:  I want to give you a chance.  Can you think

13 10:15:42   of any specific meeting that we can now go and look at

14 10:15:47   in which the contracting authority said anything like:

15 10:15:50   you, the contractor, should be working out where the

16 10:15:53   rock fill goes but you're not doing that so we're now

17 10:15:56   going to have to tell you.

18 10:15:58       Are you aware of any meeting you can tell us about

19 10:16:01   where that happened?

20 10:16:02.  I don't have any memory of anything like that.  Of any

21 10:16:08   of those meetings.

22 10:16:09HE PRESIDENT:  Right.  Are you aware of any letter or

23 10:16:11   anything where something like that was said by the

24 10:16:13   contracting authority, ie: you the contractor should be

25 10:16:17   working out where the rock fill goes but you're not


                                      25






 1 10:16:19   doing so, so we will tell you.

 2 10:16:22       Any letter or anything?

 3 10:16:31.  I don't really have a lot of memories of most of these

 4 10:16:34   letters.

 5 10:16:35HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Let me ask you one last thing before

 6 10:16:37   I stop.  It's back in the [draft] transcript, if we look

 7 10:16:42   at page 12 of the transcript of today, page 12, line 6.

 8 10:17:00       Mr Gillion asks you at line 6: [page 12, line 13]

 9 10:17:03       "So you're saying that a contractor, given some

10 10:17:05   instructions to place rock fill in February 2021, would

11 10:17:07   be able to plan ahead his work for excavation because he

12 10:17:10   would know in which areas he would need to place rock

13 10:17:13   fill?"

14 10:17:14       And your answer was:

15 10:17:15       "Exactly, of which I'm sure the problem was they had

16 10:17:18   no quarry."

17 10:17:21       I didn't understand that answer.  What are you

18 10:17:23   referring to there?

19 10:17:24.  So the thing is that from the word go, when I joined

20 10:17:26   this side, there was no quarry, and all the works that

21 10:17:31   required a quarry to be -- to be -- your -- the required

22 10:17:33   source of material could not be done because the

23 10:17:36   contractor had no quarry.

24 10:17:38       So the contractor used that as an opportunity to

25 10:17:40   blame everyone else for them not having to do any of


                                      26






 1 10:17:42   their works that required a quarry.  So they would blame

 2 10:17:45   the SR for not instructing rock fill, they blame

 3 10:17:48   everyone.  Yet, we look at their programme, their

 4 10:17:51   programme says: you're supposed to do this, you're

 5 10:17:53   supposed to do maybe pavement works.  But they never

 6 10:17:55   started any pavement works until July 2021, that's

 7 10:17:58   almost eight months from their planned period.

 8 10:18:01       So literally for me I believe the quarry -- this

 9 10:18:03   lack of a quarry, that affected them from starting any

10 10:18:06   of these problematic sections.  And that's why even the

11 10:18:08   SR -- I'm sure -- I remember they submit, as well, the

12 10:18:11   SR told them to start doing these works here, but they

13 10:18:14   couldn't because they had no quarry.  But instead they

14 10:18:18   would look for other things to blame, so that everyone

15 10:18:21   runs away from the fact that there was no quarry, and

16 10:18:22   they couldn't do any of these works that required rock.

17 10:18:27HE PRESIDENT:  But do you say they should have been putting

18 10:18:28   in rock fill before they were given the locations as to

19 10:18:31   where to put in rock fill?

20 10:18:32.  Sorry?

21 10:18:33HE PRESIDENT:  Do you say that the contractor should have

22 10:18:34   been putting in rock fill before they were given the

23 10:18:39   precise locations of where to put it?

24 10:18:43.  But their sections where they needed the rock fill,

25 10:18:46   I don't know if there was ... I don't get your question


                                      27






 1 10:18:50   exactly.

 2 10:18:50HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  At what point do you say the

 3 10:18:54   contractor should have been putting in rock fill but

 4 10:18:58   wasn't because they had no quarry?

 5 10:19:01.  I believe after this instruction here, they were now

 6 10:19:03   supposed to plan for the rock fill.

 7 10:19:06HE PRESIDENT:  Which instruction?  The instruction in 2021?

 8 10:19:07.  Yes, February 2021.

 9 10:19:09HE PRESIDENT:  Right.  So you accept, do you, that before

10 10:19:13   that they can't be criticised for putting in rock fill?

11 10:19:18.  No.

12 10:19:18HE PRESIDENT:  You don't accept that?  What do you say

13 10:19:22   should have been happening before February 2021 with

14 10:19:25   regard to rock fill?

15 10:19:26.  Like I already said, the special specifications already

16 10:19:31   identified possible areas where rock fill would be

17 10:19:33   required.  Same with the design report.  The design

18 10:19:35   report also already had a quantity of 70,000 of rock

19 10:19:39   fill and had prospective areas where rock fill could be

20 10:19:42   done.  So that was even given at tender stage.

21 10:19:45       So from tender stage they already knew they had to

22 10:19:48   put some 70,000 cubic of rock fill somewhere on site

23 10:19:52   which, remember, these -- all these are all estimates.

24 10:19:54   So it's only at the point of construction where now the

25 10:19:56   engineer can instruct them exactly where to put.  But


                                      28






 1 10:19:59   still in their plan they should have it in mind that:

 2 10:20:01   I have some 70,000 cubic of rock fill that I'm supposed

 3 10:20:03   to put somewhere on site, but now when I reach on site,

 4 10:20:06   the SR will instruct me exactly where to put it, or even

 5 10:20:08   I can propose locations where I think the SR can do the

 6 10:20:11   work.  Because I believe they also had a right to

 7 10:20:13   propose anything.  After all, they're civil engineers

 8 10:20:14   with experience, with 20 years' experience, they're not

 9 10:20:17   just going to sit there and watch.

10 10:20:20HE PRESIDENT:  So I understand that evidence.  When do you

11 10:20:21   say the SR did instruct them where to put the rock fill?

12 10:20:27   Is it February 2021?

13 10:20:29.  I believe they had previously done that, but the only

14 10:20:34   formal communication that I can identify right now is

15 10:20:37   this one of February 2021.

16 10:20:40HE PRESIDENT:  Right.

17 10:20:53       Does either party wish to ask any further questions

18 10:20:56   arising out of that stretch of questioning by the

19 10:20:58   tribunal?

20 10:20:59R KIWANUKA:  Not from me.

21 10:21:01R GILLION:  If I may, I would just like to show an exhibit

22 10:21:05   that would be I think useful to put to the witness in

23 10:21:07   the light of your questions, and that is an exhibit that

24 10:21:11   shows exactly the timing of the instructions and the

25 10:21:14   quantities in specific locations.


                                      29






 1 10:21:18HE PRESIDENT:  That's fine.  Put it to the witness.

 2 10:21:22         Further cross-examination by Mr Gillion

 3 10:21:27R GILLION:  It's exhibit C202.  Perhaps that would clarify

 4 10:21:34   the instructions given in February 2021.

 5 10:21:37HE PRESIDENT:  Hold on.  This is from -- what is this

 6 10:21:42   document, so I understand it?

 7 10:21:43R GILLION:  It's a document that is exhibited and mentioned

 8 10:21:46   in and discussed in Mr Philip Patemann's witness

 9 10:21:55   statements.

10 10:21:55HE PRESIDENT:  It's a contemporaneous document?

11 10:21:58R GILLION:  No, it's not.  It's in our opening statement as

12 10:21:58   well --

13 10:21:59HE PRESIDENT:  I recognise it from the opening statement.

14 10:22:00   You've described it as a document.  Is it a graphical

15 10:22:04   representation?

16 10:22:05R GILLION:  It's a graphical representation of the

17 10:22:07   quantities of rock fill instructed with, as you can see,

18 10:22:13   the location at the bottom, the quantities.

19 10:22:16HE PRESIDENT:  You can ask the witness about it, but the

20 10:22:19   utility of a witness speaking to a graphical

21 10:22:21   representation of other evidence, we'll have to see,

22 10:22:25   because it's not a contemporaneous document he would

23 10:22:27   have been involved in.  But ask your question and we'll

24 10:22:29   see where we go.

25 10:22:36R GILLION:  When you explained that an instruction was


                                      30






 1 10:22:40   given in February 2021 for rock fill, I asked you how

 2 10:22:43   much quantity of rock fill was instructed then.  Would

 3 10:22:45   you agree it would be in the range of 27,600 cubic

 4 10:22:48   metres?

 5 10:22:49       You can see the graph here, there's a reference to

 6 10:22:52   an instruction in several sections from kilometre 22 to

 7 10:22:56   kilometre 47.  Would that be consistent with your

 8 10:23:00   recollection of the facts?

 9 10:23:04.  I don't know where this graph is from.  It's not

10 10:23:06   anywhere in my records so for me I don't even know what

11 10:23:09   is written here.

12 10:23:10HE PRESIDENT:  Never mind the graph.  The question that's

13 10:23:12   been put to you is: to the best of your recollection,

14 10:23:16   was what was instructed in February 2021 about 27,000

15 10:23:22   cubic metres of rock fill?

16 10:23:26.  27,000?  That figure I'm even seeing for the first time.

17 10:23:32R GILLION:  So you have literally no recollection at all --

18 10:23:34.  No, the figure was much higher than 27,000.

19 10:23:38.  That's your recollection, it was much higher?

20 10:23:40.  Yes.

21 10:23:41.  And if I were to tell you that sometime in August 2023

22 10:23:44   there were further significant rock fill instructions in

23 10:23:48   the range of 32 to 33 -- I can't really see -- yes,

24 10:23:52   about 32,000 cubic metres of rock fill in August 2023

25 10:23:55   instructed, would that be consistent with your


                                      31






 1 10:23:59   recollection?

 2 10:24:00.  Sorry, around August?

 3 10:24:02.  August 2023.

 4 10:24:09.  But this graph here, I don't know why I should even

 5 10:24:11   answer --

 6 10:24:13HE PRESIDENT:  Let's do this.  Let's take down the graph

 7 10:24:17   off the screen.

 8 10:24:18R GILLION:  I can refer to the instructions if you want.

 9 10:24:20   It would take more time, but --

10 10:24:22HE PRESIDENT:  No, put the figures you want to put.

11 10:24:24R GILLION:  Would it be consistent with your recollection

12 10:24:27   that sometime in August 2023 there were around 32,000 to

13 10:24:31   33,000 cubic metres of rock fill instructed?

14 10:24:36.  Is there a letter instructing that?

15 10:24:39.  There certainly is.

16 10:24:40.  Maybe you show it to me.

17 10:25:17.  There are various letters because these instructions

18 10:25:18   were given verbally.  In a drip feed fashion.

19 10:25:25HE PRESIDENT:  Mr Gillion --

20 10:25:26R GILLION:  This is going to take some time.

21 10:25:28HE PRESIDENT:  It's up to you, you have time.  My point is

22 10:25:31   if you're going to put a document, put the document,

23 10:25:33   but --

24 10:25:35R GILLION:  No, no, but it's going to take some time to

25 10:25:37   find all the verbal instructions and put them to the


                                      32






 1 10:25:41   witness.

 2 10:25:45HE PRESIDENT:  You take your course.

 3 10:26:20       (Pause)

 4 10:27:15       Mr Gillion, if there is a series of documents, you

 5 10:27:17   may take the view that you don't need to put them to

 6 10:27:18   this witness to make the point you need to make --

 7 10:27:21R GILLION:  These instructions are on the record.

 8 10:27:30       I can maybe ask you whether you remember whether

 9 10:27:33   instructions were given for rock fill around the summer

10 10:27:37   2023 for the kilometre 60 to 65 -- kilometres 60 to 65.

11 10:27:51   Is that the area where you mentioned only 7 kilometres

12 10:27:53   were affected?  Would this area 60 to 65 be consistent

13 10:27:59   with your recollection?

14 10:28:03.  Like I said in my witness statement --

15 10:28:06.  I'm asking your recollection.  Do you remember roughly,

16 10:28:09   very specific, 7 kilometres were affected by rock fill.

17 10:28:14   I'm putting to you, would this be consistent with your

18 10:28:16   recollection, kilometres 60 to 65, was this affected by

19 10:28:19   the necessity to put rock fill?

20 10:28:23.  My recollection of the events that happen was the

21 10:28:25   contractor requested for the rock fill to be done in

22 10:28:28   those sections and the SR did not object to them.

23 10:28:34   That's why I'm sure you'll not find a letter, maybe,

24 10:28:38   probably.  I don't know if it is there, but my

25 10:28:39   recollection is there is no letter of the SR


                                      33






 1 10:28:42   instructing: do rock fill in these sections.  Why?

 2 10:28:45   Because the rock fill actually was initiated by the

 3 10:28:47   contractor.  They requested that: why they do rock fill

 4 10:28:50   in these sections.  Since they were finding it hard to

 5 10:28:53   actually work on those sections.  They had failed to

 6 10:28:55   work on those sections.

 7 10:29:06       So the SR, being very kind, I believe, in my

 8 10:29:06   opinion, offered them to do the rock fill since it was

 9 10:29:06   a much faster process, and to help them solve those

10 10:29:07   problematic sections much quicker.

11 10:29:07       Because remember, there are two ways of solving

12 10:29:09   problematic soil sections.  One, you can remove the

13 10:29:12   whole problematic soil section at whatever depth and you

14 10:29:15   refill back whatever, how many layers it may take.  It

15 10:29:18   can take even up to 20 layers, that's not a problem.

16 10:29:20       But the other easier way is you can remove part of

17 10:29:23   it and put rock fill as a stabilising layer and after

18 10:29:26   you build your G7.

19 10:29:28       So what I remember, from kilometre 59 up to the end

20 10:29:31   of the project, the SR agreed, based on the contractor's

21 10:29:34   proposal, to do rock fill, the SR agreed that they

22 10:29:37   should do, actually do that small rock fill, I don't

23 10:29:40   know, is it 1 metre or something like that.  They

24 10:29:42   proposed, the contractor proposed and the SR agreed to

25 10:29:44   them, and that is why the works were measured and


                                      34






 1 10:29:46   approved.

 2 10:29:47       But as for a letter maybe instructing, I don't

 3 10:29:49   remember any letter.  If it is there, then probably SR

 4 10:29:52   wrote after.  But from my recollection on site, there

 5 10:29:55   was no such kind of letter.  That's why you see no

 6 10:29:57   instructions in those areas are.

 7 10:29:59.  So your evidence is that the SR suggested: do rock fill

 8 10:30:02   wherever it's required?

 9 10:30:04.  The contractor, the claimant, suggested: I'll do rock

10 10:30:07   fill.  The SR did not object.

11 10:30:08.  My question was very simple: is your evidence that the

12 10:30:11   SR suggested you do rock fill wherever it is required?

13 10:30:15.  The contractor suggested do rock fill.  The SR did not

14 10:30:18   object.  There's a difference between did not object and

15 10:30:21   instructed.  The SR did not object.

16 10:30:27.  There's no reference anywhere in the records -- so

17 10:30:32   there's no evidence of any instruction along the lines:

18 10:30:36   do rock fill wherever it's required?

19 10:30:41.  I don't know.  I cannot recall anything like that.  But

20 10:30:45   what I know is it was the contractor who wanted that

21 10:30:48   rock fill.

22 10:30:54.  And would you agree that rock fill then executed was

23 10:30:58   paid, the measured quantities of rock fill?

24 10:31:01.  I believe, since the -- based on letters, IPs that has

25 10:31:06   been certified, what has been done has been certified


                                      35






 1 10:31:10   and approved based on whatever they have agreed to

 2 10:31:14   measure.

 3 10:31:15.  Because it was required?

 4 10:31:16.  Yes.  Because whatever is -- this is an admeasured

 5 10:31:16   contract.  As long as you do and it's certified, it is

 6 10:31:20   paid.

 7 10:31:31HE PRESIDENT:  The tribunal has not formed a view on this,

 8 10:31:34   but can see that the evidence that the witness has

 9 10:31:37   given, that when it got to a certain point the

10 10:31:42   contractor suggested that rock fill might be needed and

11 10:31:44   the SR agreed, might potentially be relevant.  The

12 10:31:50   witness has given that evidence and you've not

13 10:31:52   challenged that.  It may be because you don't wish to

14 10:31:54   challenge it, but that might be relevant evidence.

15 10:32:00       So I flag that up in case you do want to challenge

16 10:32:02   it.

17 10:32:03R GILLION:  Is it fair to say that at some point in time in

18 10:32:08   the end of the project or in 2024 there were

19 10:32:12   instructions given to use ... (Pause).

20 10:33:06       We can put to the witness exhibit C-506, for

21 10:33:17   example, a letter from Strabag dated 12 January 2024

22 10:33:36   where you can see an example of confirmation of verbal

23 10:33:39   instructions in relation to rock fill.  The location is

24 10:33:45   kilometre 62 to kilometre 63 and you can see the letter

25 10:33:51   saying:


                                      36






 1 10:33:51       "This is to confirm your verbal instruction(s)

 2 10:33:54   issued on site following numerous site visits [in that

 3 10:34:00   location]."

 4 10:34:01       You can see the fourth paragraph:

 5 10:34:07       "The Contractor notes that the instruction over this

 6 10:34:09   section of the road accumulates to a total of 10,800

 7 10:34:13   [cubic metres] of rock fill."

 8 10:34:14       Can you see that instruction or confirmation of

 9 10:34:16   instruction?

10 10:34:17.  Yes.

11 10:34:20.  Do you agree that this is confirmation of an instruction

12 10:34:22   given?

13 10:34:28.  Like what I said on site, these sections here, the SR

14 10:34:33   already given an instruction on what he believed this

15 10:34:35   was supposed to be done, but the contractor was --

16 10:34:37   I don't know what was wrong with the contractor at that

17 10:34:39   time.  Probably -- I don't know if it is a problem of

18 10:34:43   planning or something.  They claimed they preferred

19 10:34:47   using the rock fill.

20 10:34:49.  Would you agree that in this letter Strabag confirmed

21 10:34:51   that an instruction was given for roughly 11,000 cubic

22 10:34:56   metres of rock fill?

23 10:34:57.  Maybe now you should ask -- we should ask exactly what

24 10:35:01   happened in those site visits.  Because the site visits,

25 10:35:03   the SR was not there alone.


                                      37






 1 10:35:05.  Do you remember any letter sent in response to this

 2 10:35:08   letter saying: no, no, no, I haven't given you

 3 10:35:12   an instruction?

 4 10:35:15.  I don't remember any letter like that.

 5 10:35:18.  But you do actually -- your evidence is that no

 6 10:35:21   instruction was given; it was simply Strabag taking the

 7 10:35:27   initiative to do rock fill --

 8 10:35:30.  Then maybe you show me a letter from the SR saying,

 9 10:35:32   instructing that.

10 10:35:33HE PRESIDENT:  I'm sorry, I don't think that's a fair

11 10:35:34   question.  That's not what the witness was saying.

12 10:35:37   I understand the witness to be saying the instruction

13 10:35:39   was given because the contractor wanted to use rock

14 10:35:44   fill, suggested it, and the SR agreed.  So I don't --

15 10:35:50   this might be important and I think we need to be

16 10:35:53   careful because that's not -- that's what I understand

17 10:35:54   the witness to be saying.

18 10:35:59R GILLION:  I'll need to look at the transcript again.

19 10:36:01   I didn't quite understand that to be his evidence.

20 10:36:23S DOERRIES:  [Draft] page 33 might be the clearest, I don't

21 10:36:28   know, from lines 3 to 9.

22 10:36:49R GILLION:  Can I show you another letter.  C-457.  We

23 10:37:06   should see here another confirmation of verbal

24 10:37:09   instruction.  This time it's for roughly 12,000 cubic

25 10:37:16   metres of rock fill.  So August 2023.  The contractor


                                      38






 1 10:37:29   says here in that location, kilometre 60 to 62:

 2 10:37:43       "We are writing to confirm your verbal instruction

 3 10:37:45   issued on site on the 16th of August 2023; 'Excavate to

 4 10:37:50   spoil expansive black cotton clay soil 0.6m depth and

 5 10:37:52   replace with 0.7m of rockfill'."

 6 10:37:57       Would you not consider this to be a clear

 7 10:38:02   instruction given by the SR?

 8 10:38:06.  I believe the SR should answer this question.

 9 10:38:10.  I would love to ask this question to the SR but no

10 10:38:15   witness has been presented by the respondent in this

11 10:38:18   arbitration.  Would you consider this to be instruction:

12 10:38:25       "Excavate to spoil expansive black cotton clay soil

13 10:38:29   0.6m [quite specific, that] and replace with 0.7m of

14 10:38:34   rockfill."

15 10:38:35       Is that a clear instruction?

16 10:38:35.  I believe the SR should answer this question.

17 10:38:39.  It's a "yes" or "no" question.

18 10:38:41S DOERRIES:  Yes, so you just need -- you've been asked the

19 10:38:42   question.  Can you answer it?

20 10:38:44.  I've been asked the question.  As -- I represent the

21 10:38:46   supervisor, I don't represent the SR.

22 10:39:18R GILLION:  Would you agree that without instructions from

23 10:39:25   the supervisor or the supervisor's representative,

24 10:39:30   Strabag would not be able to place rock fill without

25 10:39:33   instructions?


                                      39






 1 10:39:36.  Without instructions?  (Pause)

 2 10:39:54       That's a technical question, I need to revise the

 3 10:39:56   specification to see exactly.

 4 10:40:01R GILLION:  Maybe we can turn to the special specification

 5 10:40:03   if that's what the witness requires to answer the

 6 10:40:05   question.

 7 10:40:08.  But it's a matter of interpretation of contract.  If the

 8 10:40:11   specification says they can, then they can.  If it says

 9 10:40:13   they cannot, then they cannot.  So it's not about my

10 10:40:17   opinion.

11 10:40:20       So I believe that question there can be answered by

12 10:40:22   the specification.  So if the specification says it can,

13 10:40:24   then it can.  If it says it cannot, then it cannot.  My

14 10:40:28   opinion doesn't matter.

15 10:40:40.  Do you recall the contractor Strabag placing rock fill

16 10:40:43   without instructions?

17 10:40:48.  I think I'm repeating myself again and again and again.

18 10:40:51   Maybe just to make it very clear: rock fill was

19 10:40:57   instructed by the SR in a letter, which are probably

20 10:41:01   exhibited already by this time, rock fills that don't

21 10:41:04   see any instruction.  Most of them, they were site

22 10:41:07   investigations, the contractor wanted rock fill, the SR

23 10:41:09   did not object.  That's why even if the SR -- the

24 10:41:12   contractor gave a letter to confirm verbal instruction,

25 10:41:15   the SR did not respond, or even if they responded, they


                                      40






 1 10:41:19   responded a certain way.

 2 10:41:21       So the main point is that these are admeasured

 3 10:41:24   contract.  If the contractor does certain work and the

 4 10:41:26   SR is in agreement with the work they have done, they

 5 10:41:29   measure it, certify it and pay it.  The whole point of

 6 10:41:32   payment is about measurement, being an admeasurement

 7 10:41:35   contract.  That's my understanding of this.  So anything

 8 10:41:38   to do with if you instruct, if you don't instruct, those

 9 10:41:41   are specification requirements.  So which for me my

10 10:41:44   opinion doesn't matter in this case.  It's about the

11 10:41:48   contract.

12 10:41:50.  But the special specifications do form part of the

13 10:41:52   contract.

14 10:41:53.  Exactly.  So what the specification says, you go with

15 10:41:56   it.  Don't go with my opinion.

16 10:42:06R GILLION:  We've covered the point.  Thank you, no further

17 10:42:07   questions.

18 10:42:10HE PRESIDENT:  So that, no criticism whatsoever, that went

19 10:42:12   wider and there were some points raised which weren't

20 10:42:15   raised during the first stretch of cross-examination.

21 10:42:17   Is there any re-examination on any of that?

22 10:42:20R KIWANUKA:  No, Mr President, I'm good.

23 10:42:22HE PRESIDENT:  I have no more questions on it.

24 10:42:25       Thank you very much indeed, sir, for coming back

25 10:42:28   this morning, for helping the tribunal with that.  You


                                      41






 1 10:42:29   are now released, which means you can either leave or,

 2 10:42:33   if the respondent would like you to, you are free to

 3 10:42:37   watch the remaining evidence.  So thank you very much.

 4 10:42:40.  You're welcome.

 5 10:42:41                (The witness was released)

 6 10:42:43HE PRESIDENT:  Right.  So as I understand it, that now is

 7 10:42:46   the conclusion of the factual evidence by each side; is

 8 10:42:50   that right?

 9 10:42:51R GILLION:  Correct.

10 10:42:52HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Let us then move to the expert phase.

11 10:43:01       Can I suggest we give our transcriber a 10-minute

12 10:43:05   break at this stage and it may be today we'll build in

13 10:43:08   one or two extra little breaks.  That 10 minutes will

14 10:43:15   enable the delay expert I think for the claimant to take

15 10:43:18   the stand and get ready to make his presentation.

16 10:43:23       So it is now 10.43 by my clock.  Can we -- if we

17 10:43:29   take 10 minutes and have perhaps two 10-minute breaks

18 10:43:33   this morning rather than one 15, can we be back, please,

19 10:43:36   by 10.53 with the expert ready to go.

20 10:43:4010.43 am)

21 10:43:44                     (A short break)

22 10:53:1710.53 am)

23 10:54:16HE PRESIDENT:  Okay, I call everyone to order.

24 10:54:21       As I understand where we now are, we're going to

25 10:54:23   hear from the claimant's delay expert, who is going to


                                      42






 1 10:54:33   first proceed by making a 15-minute presentation, for

 2 10:54:37   which we have the slides.  That being so ...

 3 10:54:48                 MR LEE COOKSON (called)

 4 10:54:52HE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, how are you?

 5 10:54:54.  I'm very well, thank you.

 6 10:54:55HE PRESIDENT:  There should be -- what have the parties

 7 10:54:56   agreed in terms of the form of words that the experts

 8 10:54:56   shall use?  Have they agreed a different form of the

 9 10:55:00   words --

10 10:55:00.  I'm fine with the words on the sheet here.

11 10:55:02HE PRESIDENT:  Fine.  Are those words on the sheet the

12 10:55:04   words that the parties have agreed should be used for

13 10:55:04   the experts, or have they not applied their minds to

14 10:55:07   that?

15 10:55:07R GILLION:  We haven't applied our minds to that.

16 10:55:08HE PRESIDENT:  That's fine.  If you haven't, we'll just use

17 10:55:08   the same form of words.

18 10:55:11       So if you could lift up your right hand, please, and

19 10:55:17   say the form of words on the card in front of you.

20 10:55:20.  I, Lee Cookson, do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare

21 10:55:24   and affirm that the evidence I shall give is the truth,

22 10:55:26   the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

23 10:55:31HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr Cookson.

24 10:55:33       How I would like us to proceed is for your -- for

25 10:55:36   those who instruct you to put your reports to you and


                                      43






 1 10:55:40   get you to confirm the accuracy of them, and then you

 2 10:55:42   can move to make the presentation.

 3 10:55:51            Examination-in-chief by MR GILLION

 4 10:55:54R GILLION:  Good morning, Mr Cookson.  You have prepared

 5 10:55:56   four reports on delay in this arbitration?

 6 10:55:58.  I have.

 7 10:55:59.  These are -- and I'll give them to you.  Will you

 8 10:56:08   confirm that they have all been signed?

 9 10:56:12.  Give me a second, please.

10 10:56:18.  You can put the appendices aside.  Do you recognise

11 10:56:21   these four reports?  Are they your reports?  I would

12 10:56:38   like you to turn to the last page of each of these

13 10:56:42   reports and confirm whether --

14 10:56:44.  Yes.  Sorry, one sec.

15 10:56:49.  Sure.  (Pause)

16 10:57:00.  Sorry, yes.  The first report is signed and it's my

17 10:57:06   report.

18 10:57:12       The second report is signed and it's my report.

19 10:57:21       The third report is signed and it's my report.

20 10:57:29       The fourth report is signed and it's my report.

21 10:57:32.  Would you like to confirm that all four reports are true

22 10:57:36   to the best of your knowledge and opinion?

23 10:57:39.  Yes.

24 10:57:48R GILLION:  And there will be a question of presenting to

25 10:57:49   the tribunal and the parties your analysis in


                                      44






 1 10:57:53   15 minutes.

 2 10:57:55.  Yes, thank you.

 3 10:58:00                Presentation by MR COOKSON

 4 10:58:08.  So I'm going to talk a little bit about planning of the

 5 10:58:11   project and I'm going to highlight some of the key

 6 10:58:15   differences between Mr Singhal's approach and my own,

 7 10:58:19   and I'm going to do that by reference to a couple of

 8 10:58:21   examples.  Then I'm going to very briefly touch on

 9 10:58:24   quantities, production rates and resourcing.

10 10:58:29       So the road, 67 kilometres long, divided into two

11 10:58:34   phases.  For work planning Strabag split phase one into

12 10:58:39   three linear work sections, sections 1 to 3, and it

13 10:58:44   split phase two into four linear sections, 4 to 7.

14 10:58:50       So I borrowed a chart from Mr Singhal on this slide.

15 10:58:54   So this is his high-level representation of PoIT rev 0,

16 10:58:57   and the different activities in each section are

17 10:59:06   colour-coded, so the different colours represent the

18 10:59:08   same work activity in each section.

19 10:59:11       So the sections 1 to 7 are on the vertical axis on

20 10:59:16   the left-hand side, and the timeline is horizontally

21 10:59:20   across the top.

22 10:59:21       So the plan essentially was to start in section 1 at

23 10:59:24   the top left-hand side of the corner and then progress

24 10:59:27   through the sections down to section 7 at the bottom

25 10:59:32   right-hand side corner.


                                      45






 1 10:59:36       So phase one I've highlighted in the box at the top,

 2 10:59:41   left-hand side, so that's sections 1 to 3, and the plan

 3 10:59:43   here was to start in the middle of the road, roughly

 4 10:59:48   chainage 30, and work southwards towards Atiak at

 5 10:59:53   chainage 0.

 6 10:59:56       Phase two, the plan was to return to the middle of

 7 10:59:59   the road, chainage 30, and then progress in a northerly

 8 11:00:04   direction to chainage 66 at Laropi.

 9 11:00:09       I've highlighted on this slide the cut to spoil

10 11:00:12   activities in each of the sections.  They're all

11 11:00:18   represented by the red bar.

12 11:00:23       If you track your eyes through the red bars you'll

13 11:00:26   see that they're linear in terms of planning, they're

14 11:00:29   end-to-end through the sections all the way from

15 11:00:31   section 1 to section 7 at the end.

16 11:00:34       If you look at the top left-hand side of the corner,

17 11:00:36   of the chart, you can see that cut to spoil was

18 11:00:40   initially required to get things going in order to place

19 11:00:44   the road layers above.  And then if you track down

20 11:00:46   through to the last red bar, which is section 7 at the

21 11:00:50   end, you can see that there's quite a significant gap

22 11:00:53   between the cut to spoil and the first road layer, which

23 11:00:57   is the next blue bar at the bottom of the chart.

24 11:01:05       So in terms of the planning, cut to spoil became

25 11:01:08   increasingly less important for delivery of the project


                                      46






 1 11:01:11   because it obtained float as the works progressed

 2 11:01:14   through this programme.  So in planning terms, the gap

 3 11:01:20   between the cut to spoil in section 7 and the start of

 4 11:01:22   the next activity, the blue bar at the bottom, is called

 5 11:01:29   float, it's essentially a time buffer, which means that

 6 11:01:31   the cut to spoil could be delayed for a period before it

 7 11:01:35   has any impact on the next layer in the final section.

 8 11:01:44       I've highlighted here the last section 3 of

 9 11:01:47   phase one and the first section 4 of phase two in the

10 11:01:51   broken boxes and I've added a red arrow just to signify

11 11:01:55   that the cut to spoil in phase two was planned to follow

12 11:02:01   on directly after the cut to spoil in phase one, so

13 11:02:05   there's a resource dependency between phase one and

14 11:02:09   phase two.

15 11:02:10       I mention that because Mr Singhal is of the view

16 11:02:12   that there was no dependency at all between phase one

17 11:02:16   and phase two.

18 11:02:17HE PRESIDENT:  Can I ask, in the actual programme itself,

19 11:02:18   is there a logic link within the -- shown on the

20 11:02:22   programme?  Or is this an implication that you've taken

21 11:02:26   using your expertise?

22 11:02:27.  No, in PoIT rev 0, the proper version, the full version,

23 11:02:32   there's a logic link between cut to spoil, end-to-end,

24 11:02:36   and between phase one and phase two, exactly as I've

25 11:02:40   shown it there.


                                      47






 1 11:02:41HE PRESIDENT:  Right, thank you.

 2 11:02:43.  So on this slide I've highlighted the next road

 3 11:02:49   construction activity, which is G7, and that's

 4 11:02:54   represented by the blue bars on the slide here.  If you

 5 11:02:56   track through with your eye the blue bars, you can see

 6 11:02:59   that it's a continuous flow of work from start to

 7 11:03:02   finish, from section 1 all the way through to section 7.

 8 11:03:08       If you do the same exercise with any other colours

 9 11:03:11   representing different activities, you can see that

10 11:03:14   that's not the same for anything else.

11 11:03:17       So, for example, if you look at the green bars,

12 11:03:19   which are G15, which is the next layer on top of the G7,

13 11:03:24   there are some significant gaps between one green bar

14 11:03:28   and the next, which means there's a good degree of

15 11:03:32   float, if you like, on the G15 between one section and

16 11:03:35   the next.

17 11:03:37       So it's quite obvious, looking at this chart and

18 11:03:40   tracking through the G7, that rev 3 was driven, if you

19 11:03:48   like, by the placement of the G7 fill through the

20 11:03:51   programme.

21 11:03:55       Now, in practice, the actual sequence didn't depart

22 11:04:01   too much from that plan in rev 3.  One difference was

23 11:04:05   that rather than being a linear progression through each

24 11:04:09   section, in phase one some of the -- well, all of the

25 11:04:13   sections 1 to 3 at different times were overlapped so


                                      48






 1 11:04:16   there was a degree of parallel working.  The sections

 2 11:04:21   weren't stacked, but they were staggered, so at any

 3 11:04:24   particular time there might have been G7 fill being

 4 11:04:27   placed in three sections at one time.

 5 11:04:30HE PRESIDENT:  Sorry, Mr Cookson, on this slide am

 6 11:04:32   I looking at not planning, but actual then?

 7 11:04:34.  No, no, this is still the plan.  I'm just describing the

 8 11:04:38   divergence between the plan and what happened in

 9 11:04:40   practice.

10 11:04:41HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

11 11:04:44.  The only other exception to that general sequence of the

12 11:04:48   flow of work was to section 5 in phase two.  So

13 11:04:55   section 5 passed through Adjumani Town, and the works in

14 11:05:03   section 5 started, and then they were paused for

15 11:05:05   a period of time, and then they restarted and were

16 11:05:08   completed later on.  So section 5 was essentially split

17 11:05:12   in two.  So that wasn't accounted for in rev 3, but

18 11:05:15   that's what happened in practice.

19 11:05:17       So those are the only real departures in terms of

20 11:05:19   the planning in rev 3.

21 11:05:25       I'm just going to run through some of the

22 11:05:27   differences in Mr Singhal's approach and my own.

23 11:05:35       So my opinion is that G7 fill was a critical

24 11:05:38   activity, and it was completion of that activity that

25 11:05:42   drove the forward progress of the project.  It was the


                                      49






 1 11:05:46   G7 that created the momentum of the project from start

 2 11:05:50   to finish.

 3 11:05:56       So on my analysis, if G7 fill was placed in three

 4 11:05:59   sections at the one time, then all those three sections

 5 11:06:03   were critical at that time, because it was the

 6 11:06:06   completion of the work, not the completion of

 7 11:06:08   an individual section, that drove progress through the

 8 11:06:13   project and affected the completion date.

 9 11:06:19       And where rock fill was placed prior to placing G7,

10 11:06:23   that slowed down the pace at which the G7 could be

11 11:06:28   placed above.  So on my analysis, rock fill increased

12 11:06:34   from 0 metres cubed to around about 116 metres cubed in

13 11:06:39   the main road, and G7 fill increased by about

14 11:06:42   484,000 metres cubed.

15 11:06:46       On my analysis, the late start of later sections in

16 11:06:51   the programme were a product of all of the G7 fill that

17 11:06:55   was placed in earlier sections.

18 11:07:01       In contrast, Mr Singhal treats each section as a

19 11:07:04   standalone mini project.  He considers each section is

20 11:07:10   entirely independent of all others and assumes unlimited

21 11:07:14   resources.

22 11:07:17       He considers that each section should have started

23 11:07:20   on the planned date in PoIT rev 0, regardless of the

24 11:07:24   additional work that was undertaken for G7 in preceding

25 11:07:30   sections.


                                      50






 1 11:07:32       Just very quickly on quantities, the starting

 2 11:07:36   position that I take is Strabag's measurement of the

 3 11:07:38   tender drawings, which became the issued for

 4 11:07:43   construction drawings, and were subsequently represented

 5 11:07:46   in PoIT rev 0.  So that is G7 fill at a quantity of

 6 11:07:51   514,911 metres cubed and rock fill at zero metres cube.

 7 11:08:01       Mr Singhal starts from the BOQ quantity of 883,715,

 8 11:08:08   and rock fill at 7,000 metres cubed.

 9 11:08:11       So, I'm just going to run through a couple of

10 11:08:13   examples highlighting the differences between us.

11 11:08:16       So this is window 3.  I've highlighted phase one on

12 11:08:21   the slide, and what happened in practice, the G7 fill

13 11:08:27   quantities in phase one increased and the blue bars took

14 11:08:33   longer to finish.  So, in effect, the last piece of G7

15 11:08:40   fill in phase one section 3 finished on about 6 January

16 11:08:46   2022, and the G7 fill in phase two started a couple of

17 11:08:52   weeks later on 19 January 2022, and I say there's

18 11:08:55   a causal link between the late completion of phase one

19 11:08:59   and the start of the follow-on phase two.

20 11:09:05       In contrast, Mr Singhal takes the view that

21 11:09:10   phase two G7 should have started in August 2021 on the

22 11:09:15   planned date in rev 3, and he takes no account of the

23 11:09:20   additional quantities in phase one that tied up

24 11:09:24   resources for a longer period until those works were

25 11:09:27   finished in January 2022.


                                      51






 1 11:09:32       So there's very little difference between us in

 2 11:09:34   terms of quantification of delay.  I'm at 167 days,

 3 11:09:39   Mr Singhal is at 162 days.  So we're broadly the same on

 4 11:09:44   that.  There's just a difference between us on the

 5 11:09:47   causation.

 6 11:09:49       Mr Singhal's view is that phase two didn't start,

 7 11:09:53   essentially because Strabag were pursuing

 8 11:09:56   an administrative order before starting phase two, and

 9 11:10:01   that conclusion takes no account of the additional G7

10 11:10:05   placed in phase one, and it also takes no account of the

11 11:10:11   supervisor's approval of the line and levels design

12 11:10:15   changes for phase two on 20 December 2021.

13 11:10:21       Just looking at another example now, this is

14 11:10:23   window 5.  Window 5 covers the interval that I explained

15 11:10:29   earlier between the start of section 5 and then the

16 11:10:32   later completion of section 5.  So this is the period

17 11:10:36   where no works was -- or very little work was undertaken

18 11:10:39   in section 5.

19 11:10:42       So on my analysis, I've assessed a delay of 83 days

20 11:10:46   arising from additional quantities of G7 and rock fill

21 11:10:49   that was placed in section 4, section 6 and section 7

22 11:10:54   over this period, and a very small amount of work that

23 11:10:59   was placed in section 5 also.

24 11:11:03       In contrast to that, in contrast to my 83-day delay

25 11:11:10   quantification, Mr Singhal has a delay assessment of


                                      52






 1 11:11:15   131 days over the window 5 period, and he splits that in

 2 11:11:19   two.  Window 5a, he has a delay of 64 days which he says

 3 11:11:29   is due to slow progress of G7 fill in section 5 due to

 4 11:11:33   relocation of resources to other sections, whereas in

 5 11:11:37   fact virtually no work was undertaken in section 5 over

 6 11:11:42   this period.

 7 11:11:44       And then his second part, window 5b, is a 67-day

 8 11:11:49   delay -- sorry, a 67 calendar day period where he says

 9 11:11:54   a 67-day delay occurred and on his analysis

10 11:11:59   a day-for-day critical delay occurred through this

11 11:12:02   period.  So effectively the project stood still for

12 11:12:04   67 days.

13 11:12:08       This chart just shows the volume of G7 fill that was

14 11:12:12   placed over that window 5 period.  So in total,

15 11:12:16   172,000-odd metres cubed of G7 was placed in window 5

16 11:12:21   with an overall average production rate of over

17 11:12:25   1,000 metres cubed a day, which is well above Strabag's

18 11:12:29   planned average production rate of 812.5 metres cubed

19 11:12:34   a day.  So Mr Singhal takes no account of this because

20 11:12:37   he says nothing was going on in section 5 at this time.

21 11:12:42   So I disagree with him on that.

22 11:12:45       Just for completeness, this chart just shows some

23 11:12:48   rock fill that was also placed over this period, and as

24 11:12:52   I mentioned earlier, rock fill in the locations of rock

25 11:12:57   fill dictates the pace at which G7 fill can be placed


                                      53






 1 11:13:02   directly above.

 2 11:13:03       Just very quickly on production rates, these are my

 3 11:13:05   production rates which I've used as a baseline norm in

 4 11:13:09   my analysis.

 5 11:13:10       So cut to spoil is 545 metres cubed a day.  That's

 6 11:13:14   agreed with Mr Singhal.  Rock fill is 170.  G7 fill is

 7 11:13:19   812.5.

 8 11:13:21       Mr Singhal's opinion on production rates is a little

 9 11:13:27   unclear.  In his reports he's used 1,624 for rock fill

10 11:13:34   and 1,473 for G7, but in the joint statement he's also

11 11:13:41   introduced some other rates, which he says prevail over

12 11:13:44   all others, but he hasn't used any of these rates in his

13 11:13:48   report.

14 11:13:51       Finally, just a little bit on resourcing.  G7 fill

15 11:13:55   was planned as a continuous flow of work with one gang

16 11:14:00   from section to section, all the way through from start

17 11:14:02   to finish, with one exception: there was an overlap of

18 11:14:05   one month between the completion of phase one and the

19 11:14:09   start of phase two.

20 11:14:15       So just to finish up.  On my analysis of the

21 11:14:21   514,900 metres cubed of G7 fill -- apologies, there's

22 11:14:28   a typo on the slide, at the top there it should be 911,

23 11:14:31   not 900 -- Strabag planned to place the G7 fill with one

24 11:14:36   gang working from section to section, but it would have

25 11:14:40   required two gangs for that one-month period with the


                                      54






 1 11:14:43   overlap from phase one to phase two.

 2 11:14:46       If the tribunal finds that Strabag were obligated to

 3 11:14:49   place 883,715 metres cubed, which is the BOQ quantity,

 4 11:14:54   then it would have required two gangs on G7 fill in

 5 11:14:58   order to do that.

 6 11:15:00       Mr Singhal's opinion on resourcing is a little bit

 7 11:15:03   unclear, but he starts from the premise of placing

 8 11:15:06   883,715, the BOQ quantity of G7, and he has multiple

 9 11:15:14   resource gangs to do that work ranging from three to

10 11:15:17   four, to four to five gangs.

11 11:15:20       That's it.  Thank you for listening.

12 11:15:25HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr Cookson.  I think

13 11:15:28   now we turn to the respondent for any cross-examination.

14 11:15:44             Cross-examination by MR ATWINE

15 11:15:49R ATWINE:  Thank you, Mr President.  For the record, my

16 11:15:49   name is Geoffrey Atwine, acting commissioner, civil

17 11:15:49   litigation, and I will be conducting the

18 11:15:51   cross-examination.

19 11:15:59       Good morning, Mr Cookson.

20 11:16:01.  Good morning.

21 11:16:01.  How are you?

22 11:16:02.  I am very well, thank you.

23 11:16:02.  Thank you very much for your presentation.  I enjoyed

24 11:16:04   listening to you.

25 11:16:05       So I will be taking you through a couple of


                                      55






 1 11:16:06   questions, some of which are actually attached on your

 2 11:16:09   presentation and other things.  But let's start with

 3 11:16:19   this report of yours.  Your second report of 15 November

 4 11:16:20   2024, I believe you have that in front of you?

 5 11:16:23.  I do, yes.

 6 11:16:24.  I'll be taking you through these reports.  If you

 7 11:16:26   remember what I'm saying then we can just proceed, but

 8 11:16:30   if you don't then we can go to that particular

 9 11:16:32   paragraph.  Is that okay with you?

10 11:16:33.  That's fine.

11 11:16:33.  Okay, so in this report you extended your analysis from

12 11:16:37   31 October 2023 to 26 August 2024, and then the forecast

13 11:16:44   period until November 2024.  Is that correct?

14 11:16:51.  I'm sorry, could you repeat the forecast again?

15 11:16:55.  The forecast up to November 2024.

16 11:16:58.  Yes, correct.

17 11:17:00.  Then you updated your opinion for this period from your

18 11:17:04   previous forecast in your first report; that's correct?

19 11:17:07.  Correct.

20 11:17:08.  Then you say in window 9 that there were two causes of

21 11:17:11   delay.  One caused 48 days of delay and another one

22 11:17:15   caused 11 days of further delay.  Is that correct?

23 11:17:18.  Correct.

24 11:17:19.  Okay.  Now, on page 176 of that report, you say that the

25 11:17:27   delay of 47.5 days occurred in window 9 from 31 May 2024


                                      56






 1 11:17:35   up to 1 August 2024.  Is that correct?

 2 11:17:41       If you don't recall, we can go to that particular

 3 11:17:43   paragraph?

 4 11:17:45.  Yes, no, I can see that on the screen.

 5 11:17:47.  Yes.  In your second report, that very report we are

 6 11:17:52   referring to, at page 177, as we see, you find the cause

 7 11:17:59   of 48 days' delay as line and level design changes.  Is

 8 11:18:03   that correct?

 9 11:18:08.  That is correct.

10 11:18:09.  Okay.  And this is the only reason you identify it, for

11 11:18:12   the 48 days of delay in this report; is that correct?

12 11:18:21.  That is correct.

13 11:18:22.  Good.  You did not find any dilution of resources as one

14 11:18:27   of the reasons for the 48 days' delay in this report,

15 11:18:30   correct?

16 11:18:34.  Yes, this report was based on a cut-off date of

17 11:18:44   26 August 2024, so it was forecast from that point

18 11:18:48   onwards.  In this report I'm just forecasting what the

19 11:18:53   future delay may be.

20 11:18:55.  Okay, so you did not find any dilution of resources?

21 11:18:58.  No, those works had not happened when I --

22 11:19:01.  And also you did not find any delay in the issuance of

23 11:19:04   request for inspection as a cause of delay in this

24 11:19:07   report?

25 11:19:08.  No.


                                      57






 1 11:19:08.  Okay, good.  And you also did not find any heavy

 2 11:19:12   rainfall as a cause of delay in this report, did you?

 3 11:19:14.  No.

 4 11:19:15.  Okay.  Now let's go to the joint report, the first joint

 5 11:19:18   report dated 28 April 2025.

 6 11:19:30       In this report at page 83 you updated your opinion

 7 11:19:33   on window 9, right?

 8 11:19:41.  That is correct.

 9 11:19:45.  This is the first time you updated your opinion, right?

10 11:19:52   Is this the first time you update your opinion?

11 11:19:54.  Yes.

12 11:19:55.  On window 9?

13 11:19:56.  The first joint report followed my second report.

14 11:19:59.  Okay.  And you find out now that one of the causes of

15 11:20:03   delay was resource competition between section 7 of the

16 11:20:07   main road and Adjumani Town Roads works until 1 August

17 11:20:12   2024, right?

18 11:20:14.  That is correct.

19 11:20:15.  But in this report you did not find any late RFIs or

20 11:20:20   heavy rains as a cause of delay, did you?

21 11:20:23.  That is correct.

22 11:20:24.  Now, we go to your third report.  At page 6 you are

23 11:20:30   explaining another cause of delay up to 1 August 2024.

24 11:20:36   If you don't remember, I can take you there.

 1 11:20:39.  Page 6, paragraphs 2.1.5 and 2.1.10.

 2 11:20:52       You're explaining another cause of --

 3 11:20:53.  I'm there, yes.

 4 11:20:54.  Yes.  This is also Mr Singhal's window 9a; am I correct?

 5 11:21:04.  Yes, 1 August aligns with the end of Mr Singhal's

 6 11:21:09   window 9a.

 7 11:21:12.  Good.  In this report you have identified another cause

 8 11:21:14   of delay as resource dilution, rather than resource

 9 11:21:17   competition, right?

10 11:21:22.  Well, I didn't mean anything specific by that.  Those

11 11:21:28   terms are interchangeable as far as I was concerned.

12 11:21:30   I just mean that there was resources undertaking more

13 11:21:33   than just section 7 in the main road at this time.

14 11:21:38.  Okay, so you identified resource competition -- resource

15 11:21:42   dilution as opposed to resource competition?

16 11:21:46.  Well, I don't draw a distinction between either of those

17 11:21:49   two words.  Resources were undertaking section 7 and

18 11:21:57   there were also resources undertaking other works, so my

19 11:22:00   point was simply that there was resources being shared

20 11:22:03   between section 7 and other works.

21 11:22:07.  Understood.  But in this report you did not identify any

22 11:22:12   late request for RFIs or heavy rainfall as a cause of

23 11:22:18   delay?  You didn't?

24 11:22:19.  That is true.

25 11:22:20.  In your fourth report dated 29 May 2025, just a week


                                      59






 1 11:22:25   before this hearing -- but six months after your second

 2 11:22:30   report -- you introduced for the first time delayed

 3 11:22:36   inspection of RFIs as another cause of delay for

 4 11:22:38   section 7?

 5 11:22:39.  Yes, that is true.

 6 11:22:42.  Did you identify heavy rain --

 7 11:22:44HE PRESIDENT:  Hold on.  Is your transcript working?  My

 8 11:22:49   transcript is paused.  I'm sorry to interrupt the

 9 11:22:51   questioning.  (Pause)

10 11:24:11       As long as it's being recorded, why don't we press

11 11:24:14   on and I'm sure the transcript will catch up.

12 11:24:18       So, carry on.

13 11:24:23R ATWINE:  Fair enough.

14 11:24:24       Mr Cookson, before the transcript cut-off, you said

15 11:24:24   resource dilution as opposed to resource competition,

16 11:24:24   and you couldn't draw a distinction between the two,

17 11:24:27   right?

18 11:24:28.  That is correct.  I didn't mean anything particular by

19 11:24:30   using one word or another.

20 11:24:32.  Fair enough, but you didn't identify RFI or heavy

21 11:24:35   rainfall as a cause of delay in this report, right?

22 11:24:39.  That is correct.

23 11:24:40.  Now, you go to the fourth report, which was one week

24 11:24:43   before this hearing, and you introduced for the first

25 11:24:45   time delayed inspection of RFIs as another cause of


                                      60






 1 11:24:49   delay.

 2 11:24:50.  I did.

 3 11:24:51.  But you did not identify negative rainfall as a cause of

 4 11:24:54   delay, did you?

 5 11:24:55.  No, I did not.

 6 11:24:56.  Now, in the second joint report, which is dated 2 June,

 7 11:25:02   one day before these hearings, at page 4 of your opinion

 8 11:25:08   for window 9a you did not mention -- and I assume you

 9 11:25:13   withdrew -- late inspection of RFIs as a cause of delay?

10 11:25:19       Can you see this table on the screen?  There's no

11 11:25:23   mention of late inspection of RFIs so I assume you

12 11:25:27   withdrew that reason?

13 11:25:30.  For the most part, yes.  In my fourth report I'd

14 11:25:34   identified various RFIs that were instructed during the

15 11:25:37   period and then closed out several days later.  So in my

16 11:25:44   fourth report I'd taken the entire period as being

17 11:25:48   a potential cause of delay in responding to RFIs.

18 11:25:54       Mr Singhal responded to that and said that a lot of

19 11:25:58   the RFIs were signed off on the same day or very close

20 11:26:03   to it, the next day, and the final sign-off was more

21 11:26:08   after-the-event confirmation that specifications were

22 11:26:12   being achieved and such like.

23 11:26:15       So in the second joint statement I have identified

24 11:26:21   some very marginal periods of delay where there may have

25 11:26:27   been half a day or such like caused by the RFIs, but


                                      61






 1 11:26:32   essentially what happened in most cases is that the

 2 11:26:36   works reached a certain point in time, Strabag requested

 3 11:26:41   an inspection, and quite often that happened at

 4 11:26:45   6 o'clock in the evening and the inspection was

 5 11:26:47   undertaken at 9 o'clock the next morning, so in those

 6 11:26:50   cases there was no delay.  But on some of those days the

 7 11:26:53   request was made at midday on the one day and then the

 8 11:26:58   inspection was at 9 o'clock the next morning, so I said

 9 11:27:01   potentially on those few days, and there aren't very

10 11:27:05   many --

11 11:27:05.  Mr Cookson, I'm sorry, my question was very specific --

12 11:27:06.  -- there may be half a day lost due to the late

13 11:27:08   response.

14 11:27:09.  My question was very specific.  There's no

15 11:27:12   identification of RFIs in this summary table as one of

16 11:27:16   the reasons.  So, it's not there.  It's either there or

17 11:27:18   it's not there.

18 11:27:22       But what we see here is you've introduced another

19 11:27:25   cause of delay in its place as heavy rainfall?

20 11:27:28.  Yes.

21 11:27:29.  So Mr Cookson, what was the cause of delay in section 7,

22 11:27:33   because I see four reports, so many other different

23 11:27:37   causes and one at a time; so what is the cause of delay?

24 11:27:46.  Up to the end of window 8, the delay on the project on

25 11:27:50   my analysis can be entirely explained by the additional


                                      62






 1 11:27:54   quantities of G7 and rock fill, and then, when you get

 2 11:27:57   to window 9, something changed.  The performance of --

 3 11:27:59   the completion of section 7 dropped off, which is why

 4 11:28:02   I believe the primary cause of that was the fact that

 5 11:28:06   the project is nearing completion and there's

 6 11:28:12   a bottleneck of other works which all need to be

 7 11:28:15   completed for completion of the project, and resources

 8 11:28:18   are spread thinly across all of those works, trying to

 9 11:28:22   get everything finished.  So it seems to me that the

10 11:28:27   most plausible explanation is that there was resources

11 11:28:33   being spread across a far wider stream of works than was

12 11:28:38   the case prior to that case.

13 11:28:44       In window 9a I think part of the period was

14 11:28:48   explained by the additional quantities, but there is

15 11:28:50   part of the period which is not explained by that.  So

16 11:28:54   I think the most plausible explanation for that is those

17 11:28:57   ongoing other works.

18 11:29:03       But I also looked in more detail at what other

19 11:29:07   causes may be, in response to Mr Singhal's observations

20 11:29:10   on that period, and finally, in the last of those

21 11:29:15   sequences of reports, I looked at the rainfall and

22 11:29:22   discovered that there was heavy rainfall for part of

23 11:29:25   that period, which may have explained some of that delay

24 11:29:29   over that period.

25 11:29:31.  Okay.


                                      63






 1 11:29:31.  But I don't give any firm opinions on any of that.  I've

 2 11:29:34   just said there was a period of time which it seems to

 3 11:29:37   me was probably explained by a few different things, one

 4 11:29:41   being the other ongoing works, one being the rainfall,

 5 11:29:45   and for a small number of marginal days, responses to

 6 11:29:50   RFIs.

 7 11:29:59.  Okay.  For me, it would seem to me like you were on

 8 11:29:59   a fishing expedition, but that is my opinion.

 9 11:30:02       Now, let's move on.

10 11:30:02HE PRESIDENT:  Hold on.  I don't think it helps me for you

11 11:30:04   to give opinions like that.

12 11:30:06R ATWINE:  Okay, he can dispute it.

13 11:30:08HE PRESIDENT:  But can I just pin something down.  Are you

14 11:30:10   saying there were delays caused then by requests for

15 11:30:13   inspections being issued at midday and the inspections

16 11:30:16   happening at 9 am the next morning?

17 11:30:18.  I'm just saying that --

18 11:30:20HE PRESIDENT:  But you are --

19 11:30:20.  -- half a day or -- sometimes it was 4 o'clock in the

20 11:30:23   afternoon.  So I'm just saying basically half a day was

21 11:30:26   probably lost during that period and the reason

22 11:30:30   I mention it is because the daily records are not

23 11:30:34   particularly clear and sometimes they will record

24 11:30:38   a grader or a piece of equipment being idle for the

25 11:30:41   whole day, whereas I think possibly the works continued


                                      64






 1 11:30:46   for half the day, and although the grader was recorded

 2 11:30:49   as idle, it may only have been half a day of work that

 3 11:30:52   was lost, and I believe probably because the RFI was

 4 11:30:57   sent out at midday, no works then continue until the

 5 11:31:02   inspection at 9 o'clock the next morning.  But it's

 6 11:31:04   literally two and a half days probably, something like

 7 11:31:06   that.

 8 11:31:07HE PRESIDENT:  But how long do you say is an appropriate

 9 11:31:10   window for the employer to take to do the inspection

10 11:31:13   once the RFI is issued?

11 11:31:21.  Well, I'm not saying that is an inappropriate period of

12 11:31:23   time to take.  I'm just saying --

13 11:31:25HE PRESIDENT:  Aren't you trying to establish what caused

14 11:31:26   critical delay to the works?

15 11:31:26.  Yes, so I've said that is --

16 11:31:33HE PRESIDENT:  Right, so take -- (overspeaking) -- try and

17 11:31:33   establish what has caused critical delay to the works,

18 11:31:33   presumably the planning of the works would involve some

19 11:31:38   period of time being assumed, from the contractor asking

20 11:31:40   for an inspection, to the employer doing the inspection.

21 11:31:43   It can't be instantaneous.

22 11:31:48.  If there was some time planned for that, then it's not

23 11:31:51   visible from the programme, but -- (overspeaking) --

24 11:31:52HE PRESIDENT:  You don't know what time was planned for it?

25 11:31:55.  I don't know, no.


                                      65






 1 11:31:55HE PRESIDENT:  How can you say there was critical delay

 2 11:31:57   caused by some kind of delay in inspection if you don't

 3 11:32:01   know what the planning was for what the period of time

 4 11:32:03   would be from inspection being requested to inspection

 5 11:32:07   happening?

 6 11:32:12.  Well, just from the physical progress of the works, if

 7 11:32:14   the works stop at lunchtime on one day and didn't resume

 8 11:32:19   until 9 o'clock the next day, then half a day of

 9 11:32:22   progress is lost.

10 11:32:22HE PRESIDENT:  You don't see the point I'm making that --

11 11:32:25.  No, I take your point but --

12 11:32:26HE PRESIDENT:  Because critical delay that you're trying to

13 11:32:29   establish must be -- if you're saying delays have been

14 11:32:34   caused by some failure to inspect after a request for

15 11:32:39   inspection, you have to compare, don't you, the time

16 11:32:43   that had been planned for that to happen versus the

17 11:32:49   actual time it took.  But you haven't in fact taken

18 11:32:51   a view on what time was planned for that?

19 11:32:54.  No, I have not.

20 11:32:57HE PRESIDENT:  Just explain to me in your own words how

21 11:33:00   you've established that critical delay could be caused

22 11:33:04   by that time?

23 11:33:04.  Critical delay occurs when work is not being undertaken.

24 11:33:07   So for half a day on those days, there was no work

25 11:33:11   undertaken.


                                      66






 1 11:33:13HE PRESIDENT:  Critical delay occurs, doesn't it, whenever

 2 11:33:15   more time is taken for something that had been planned?

 3 11:33:19.  Exactly.

 4 11:33:22HE PRESIDENT:  You don't know what time had been planned

 5 11:33:24   for that.

 6 11:33:26.  Well, there is no time allocated to that in PoIT rev 0.

 7 11:33:32   So whether there's an account for that within the

 8 11:33:34   planned production rates is another point.  But there

 9 11:33:38   are no activities for daily inspections and then waiting

10 11:33:42   for responses before works can proceed.

11 11:33:47HE PRESIDENT:  Should there be?

12 11:33:48.  No, I -- well, not in my view.  I mean, presumably --

13 11:33:54   I mean there are thousands of RFIs.  You would have

14 11:33:57   daily inspections.

15 11:34:00HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you.

16 11:34:16       Let's have a little break for 10 minutes and then

17 11:34:20   after we come back we can push through to 1 o'clock

18 11:34:23   then.  So why don't we have a break for 10 minutes with

19 11:34:27   people coming back for 11.44.

20 11:34:3111.34 am)

21 11:34:34                     (A short break)

22 11:43:2011.46 am)

23 11:46:19HE PRESIDENT:  Carry on then.  Thank you very much.

24 11:46:22R ATWINE:  Thank you very much, Mr President.

25 11:46:23       Mr Cookson, let's carry on from where we had stopped


                                      67






 1 11:46:27   and remember we were discussing the issue of the joint

 2 11:46:31   report and what you stated on 2 June.

 3 11:46:37       Now, in here you will see that you introduced heavy

 4 11:46:39   rainfall as a cause of delay, right?

 5 11:46:49.  That's correct.

 6 11:46:49.  I just want to ask you a question.  During this period,

 7 11:46:50   was there any notice of any claim from Strabag due to

 8 11:46:54   critical delay caused by heavy rain?  Did you come

 9 11:46:56   across anything like that?

10 11:46:56.  Not that I'm aware of, I haven't seen anything.

11 11:47:01.  Very good.  Let's move on.  Let's go to your first

12 11:47:04   report, page 21, paragraph 2.1.44.  In that third

13 11:47:14   line from the bottom, which is highlighted, you say

14 11:47:19   that:

15 11:47:22       "... I understand from Strabag ..."

16 11:47:24       But there is no evidence; right?

17 11:47:28       You see that, Mr Cookson?

18 11:47:29.  Yes, I'm just finding it.

19 11:47:32.  Let's move on.  In the second report at page 138 of your

20 11:47:39   second report, on the third line you say:

21 11:47:54       "I understand from Strabag that the lack of

22 11:47:57   instructions from Eptisa regarding the additional Rock

23 11:47:59   fill required in Section 5 by early ... 2022 was

24 11:48:04   a contributing factor ..."

25 11:48:05       You see that, Mr Cookson?  You see that?


                                      68






 1 11:48:12.  I see it.

 2 11:48:13.  And did you see any contemporaneous evidence in which

 3 11:48:16   such a reason was mentioned?

 4 11:48:30.  Um --

 5 11:48:31.  Let's first start by --

 6 11:48:34.  I've addressed the land compensation issues in my first

 7 11:48:39   report.

 8 11:48:43.  Yes, before you go there, I just want to acknowledge the

 9 11:48:45   fact that you don't refer to any evidence in this

10 11:48:48   paragraph, do you?

11 11:48:51.  No, not in that paragraph.

12 11:48:53.  Okay.  Do you remember any contemporaneous evidence in

13 11:49:02   which such a reason was mentioned?

14 11:49:19.  I don't recall the reference to rock fill from

15 11:49:22   contemporaneous --

16 11:49:23.  Okay.

17 11:49:24.  -- evidence from my memory, but certainly in relation to

18 11:49:26   the land compensation issues I remember addressing that

19 11:49:29   in my first report.

20 11:49:32.  If you don't remember, then I'm sure your counsel can

21 11:49:35   take you through that in re-examination.

22 11:49:37       But here, let's just acknowledge that you don't

23 11:49:39   reference it in this paragraph, right?

24 11:49:41.  I don't reference it in this paragraph, no.

25 11:49:43.  Okay, let's move on to page 185 of the second report.


                                      69






 1 11:50:00   Paragraph 8.5.6.  Here you provide various figures and

 2 11:50:03   say that you "understand from Strabag", and still you

 3 11:50:09   don't make any reference to any evidence; am I correct?

 4 11:50:17.  Yes, that's in relation to the forecast from the end of

 5 11:50:19   the cut-off date in that report, which I think was

 6 11:50:21   26 August, forecasting through to the project completion

 7 11:50:32   date on I think 30 November 2024 in my second report.

 8 11:50:36.  Okay.  Then at page 187, at paragraph 8.5.9(vii) here,

 9 11:50:53   you again state:

10 11:50:54       "... I understand from Strabag that the gabion boxes

11 11:50:59   were cancelled [due to] Execution Drawings.  The gabions

12 11:50:59   are installed in the river bank and can only be

13 11:50:59   installed in the dry season.  At the time of UNRA's

14 11:50:59   letter, I understand the river was full of water ..."

15 11:51:10       Again here you don't refer to any evidence, right?

16 11:51:13   There's no reference to any evidence?

17 11:51:14.  There's no reference, no.

18 11:51:16.  Okay.

19 11:51:16.  I believe the gabions are referenced in one of the

20 11:51:21   snagging and additional works lists that were issued

21 11:51:25   in November 2024, and I recall a reference on one of

22 11:51:31   those to them being deferred to the dry season.

23 11:51:40.  Then at page 197 in relation to road markings, again you

24 11:51:48   state that in relation to road markings, "I understand

25 11:51:56   from Strabag" and then "awaiting instructions".  You


                                      70






 1 11:52:01   don't provide any reference or any evidence again in

 2 11:52:05   this paragraph, Mr Cookson?

 3 11:52:20.  Again my second report is dealing with, here, future

 4 11:52:23   events that have not happened.  I mean subsequently

 5 11:52:26   I considered the whole period up to 10 December 2024.

 6 11:52:29   So here I'm saying that those outstanding road markings

 7 11:52:41   have not yet been completed and I know as a matter of

 8 11:52:43   fact that they were completed in November 2024 after the

 9 11:52:50   cut-off date of this report.

10 11:52:52.  Okay.  Now let's go to joint report number 1, the first

11 11:53:05   joint report at page 95.  Here you say:

12 11:53:26       "... I understand that Strabag did include

13 11:53:31   a quantity [of] replacement of top soil ..."

14 11:53:38       Is that correct?

15 11:53:39.  I'm sorry, which paragraph?

16 11:53:40.  Paragraph 5.2.8.  You say:

17 11:53:45       "... I understand that Strabag did include

18 11:53:47   a quantity [of] replacement of top soil ..."

19 11:53:52.  Yes, that's correct.

20 11:53:53.  And then you say:

21 11:53:54       "I ... understand from Strabag that its take-off of

22 11:53:56   G7 fill totals to 469,650 ..."

23 11:54:03       And added to 44,550, makes 514,200 cubic metres.  Is

24 11:54:14   that correct?

25 11:54:17.  That is correct.


                                      71






 1 11:54:18.  Then in the next three paragraphs below you explain the

 2 11:54:23   approach of calculations and even provide calculations;

 3 11:54:26   am I correct?

 4 11:54:26       If you could scroll down?

 5 11:54:31.  Sorry, did you say I didn't provide the calculations?

 6 11:54:34.  You provide calculations.  In the next three paragraphs.

 7 11:54:48   You explain the approach of those calculations and then

 8 11:54:51   you provide the calculations, right?

 9 11:55:07.  There was an explanation as to how Strabag determined

10 11:55:09   the topsoil strip.

11 11:55:13.  Every time in all those paragraphs you start by saying,

12 11:55:18   "I understand that Strabag".

13 11:55:24       "I understand".  You can see it on the screen.

14 11:55:27   "I understand"?

15 11:55:28.  Yes.

16 11:55:31.  Okay.  In paragraph 5.2.10 and paragraph 5.2.11 you even

17 11:55:36   went ahead to explain the reasons why Strabag allocated

18 11:55:39   certain quantities.  Am I correct?

19 11:55:41.  That is correct.

20 11:55:43.  So these paragraphs are basically a result of the

21 11:55:46   discussions you had with Strabag, which are not part of

22 11:55:49   your evidence?

23 11:55:51.  I didn't catch the last bit.  They are as a result of

24 11:55:54   discussions with Strabag, and then?

25 11:55:57.  Which were not part of evidence, at least as -- until


                                      72






 1 11:56:01   that stage?

 2 11:56:02.  At this stage they were not part of the evidence.

 3 11:56:05.  Okay.  Then in paragraph 5.3.10 on page 99 of this very

 4 11:56:12   report, Mr Singhal raises concerns on your statement and

 5 11:56:34   stated that since they were unsupported by evidence, he

 6 11:56:37   is unable to comment on your assertions.  Is that

 7 11:56:40   correct?  You can see.

 8 11:56:45.  That is what he says.  The tribunal will -- may recall

 9 11:56:50   that the evidence was subsequently --

10 11:56:53.  We're getting there.

11 11:56:53.  -- ruled to be admissible.  At the time of this report

12 11:57:00   there was a question mark as to which way the tribunal

13 11:57:05   would rule on that evidence in terms of those --

14 11:57:13   Strabag's --

15 11:57:14.  Mr Cookson, I would appreciate --

16 11:57:15.  -- documents being admissible or not.

17 11:57:15.  -- if you could first say "yes" or "no" and then you go

18 11:57:17   ahead to explain your reason.

19 11:57:18.  Sorry?

20 11:57:19.  I would appreciate if you could just say "yes" or "no"

21 11:57:21   and then you can explain the reason for the record.

22 11:57:24.  Yes; can you repeat the question, please?

23 11:57:26.  I'm saying as at that point in time, Mr Singhal raises

24 11:57:30   concerns on your statement and stated that they were

25 11:57:33   unsupported by evidence and that he was unable to


                                      73






 1 11:57:35   comment.  Yes?

 2 11:57:39.  That's what he says, yes.

 3 11:57:42.  Then on 29 May, a week before these hearings,

 4 11:57:46   Mr Carlos Lorenzo made a witness statement exactly

 5 11:57:52   explaining what you mentioned in your joint report of

 6 11:57:55   29 April.

 7 11:57:57.  That is correct.

 8 11:58:00.  So you relied on information that was not present

 9 11:58:02   in evidence, at least as until 29 April 2025, but was

10 11:58:07   only submitted in evidence on 29 May, right?

11 11:58:10.  That is true, and as I explained in the joint report,

12 11:58:16   I explained those quantities, as they had been explained

13 11:58:22   to me.

14 11:58:26.  Okay, so let's move on.

15 11:58:27       Do you think as an independent expert your opinion

16 11:58:29   should be based on evidence; is that correct?

17 11:58:32.  Correct.

18 11:58:33.  And you cannot base your opinion on speculations or

19 11:58:38   hearsay?

20 11:58:42.  Well, in relation to this matter, as I've explained, the

21 11:58:47   evidence was there.  It was just a question of whether

22 11:58:49   or not the tribunal would admit it into evidence within

23 11:58:53   the hearing.  So it's not a case that there was no

24 11:59:00   evidence as such; it's just the evidence was not at that

25 11:59:03   time put before the tribunal.  Or included within the


                                      74






 1 11:59:08   evidence within the hearing.

 2 11:59:09.  Okay.  Fair enough.  So let's move on to another topic

 3 11:59:14   of Adjumani Town Roads, which I'm sure you're very

 4 11:59:16   familiar with.  Let's see your fourth report at page 60.

 5 11:59:20       Page 60 of that report, of your fourth report, at

 6 11:59:28   paragraph 6.2.11, you say:

 7 11:59:32       "... the delay that occurred up to substantial

 8 11:59:56   completion ... was ultimately --"

 9 11:59:57.  Sorry, could you just tell me which report it was again?

10 12:00:01.  It's right on your screen, this is your fourth expert

11 12:00:04   report by Lee Cookson.

12 12:00:07.  Which one?

13 12:00:08.  Fourth.  You say that the delay was:

14 12:00:20       "... ultimately caused by the late completion of the

15 12:00:22   ATR road markings."

16 12:00:23       Is that correct?

17 12:00:24.  Yes, correct.

18 12:00:27.  And now let's look at the third report, your third

19 12:00:30   report, page 27.  That is paragraph 4.3.14.

20 12:00:50       You state that you consider ATR road markings to be

21 12:00:54   critical in window 10; is that correct?

22 12:01:03.  That is correct.

23 12:01:03.  In that same report when you look at paragraph 4.3.30 at

24 12:01:09   page 29, you say that Strabag requested details for road

25 12:01:23   markings and road signs from the respondent.  Did you


                                      75






 1 12:01:27   write that, Mr Cookson?

 2 12:01:29.  I did write that, yes.

 3 12:01:31.  Then you go ahead to say that no design was forthcoming

 4 12:01:34   from the respondent and that it was not until

 5 12:01:39   28 September 2024 that Strabag was made aware by Eptisa

 6 12:01:44   that the respondent did in fact require road markings to

 7 12:01:48   Adjumani Town Roads.  You wrote that, Mr Cook?

 8 12:01:50.  I did.

 9 12:01:52.  So you believe that it was the first time, on

10 12:01:55   28 September 2024, that Strabag came to know about the

11 12:01:59   scope of ATR road markings?

12 12:02:04.  I believe I corrected that in my fourth report.

13 12:02:11   Mr Singhal referred me to an earlier letter, if

14 12:02:13   I remember correctly.  I can't remember the exact date.

15 12:02:16.  Ah, so you acknowledge that letter now?

16 12:02:19.  Pardon?

17 12:02:19.  You acknowledge the letter now?

18 12:02:24.  Yes, I believe there's an earlier letter which

19 12:02:26   I've referenced in the subsequent report.

20 12:02:29.  Is it a letter of 30 May 2024?

21 12:02:37.  Can we have a look at it, please?  (Pause)

22 12:03:07       It's okay, I've found the reference in my fourth

23 12:03:11   report, paragraph 6.2.13, which references the 30 May

24 12:03:19   2023 letter.

25 12:03:20.  Okay, so why wasn't that letter considered in your third


                                      76






 1 12:03:23   report?

 2 12:03:26.  No reason.  I just didn't miss it -- I missed it, sorry.

 3 12:03:33   As soon as Mr Singhal brought it to my attention, then

 4 12:03:36   I considered it.

 5 12:03:37.  So you had missed it, in short?

 6 12:03:40.  (Nods head).

 7 12:03:40.  Okay.  So now you agree that the scope was known to

 8 12:03:45   Strabag as far back as 30 May 2023?

 9 12:03:49.  Well, not the scope essentially.  It knew from 30 May

10 12:03:56   2023 that -- well, that the scope in broad terms

11 12:04:01   included road marking.

12 12:04:03.  Okay, very good.  Now let's read this May 30th letter,

13 12:04:11   exhibit RSD-2-44.  RSD, pull up exhibit RSD-2-44.

14 12:04:31       This letter, can you please read the last

15 12:04:32   paragraphs?  First of all, before you go there, you see

16 12:04:35   that where it says:

17 12:04:35       "... however, the schedule for road marking and road

18 12:04:38   signs are part of the project scope."

19 12:04:43       You see that, Mr Cookson?

20 12:04:44.  I see that.

21 12:04:45.  If we go down it says:

22 12:04:47       "Please feel free to consult the undersigning,

23 12:04:50   should you require any further clarification on any

24 12:04:52   aspect of the Adjumani Town Roads before submission of

25 12:04:53   final shop drawings as requested in our letter ..."


                                      77






 1 12:04:57       You see that?

 2 12:05:00.  I see that, yes.

 3 12:05:01.  So essentially the SR invited Strabag to seek any

 4 12:05:06   clarification on ATR road markings after this letter; am

 5 12:05:08   I correct?

 6 12:05:10.  It invited them to seek clarifications, did you say?

 7 12:05:12.  Yes.

 8 12:05:13.  Yes, that is true.

 9 12:05:19.  So did you see any request by Strabag on Adjumani Town

10 12:05:22   road markings in the whole of 2024?  From the evidence?

11 12:05:30.  There are lots of exchanges, communications from Strabag

12 12:05:37   after that date.

13 12:05:40.  But did you see any in respect to ATR road markings?  In

14 12:05:51   any of those correspondences?

15 12:06:18.  (Pause).

16 12:06:32.  Mr Cookson, I can save you the time, because there isn't

17 12:06:35   any.  You won't find it.  Maybe if it's there, your

18 12:06:38   counsel will take it up in redirect.

19 12:06:40       If we could just move on to another topic.  So

20 12:06:47   I want to take you through the contract and then maybe

21 12:06:53   you can answer some of your questions.

22 12:06:56       Mr Cookson, from your recollection, what was the

23 12:06:59   contract duration for this project?

24 12:07:03.  The --

25 12:07:04.  At signing?


                                      78






 1 12:07:04.  -- original period?  30 months.

 2 12:07:08.  Okay.  And at the time of signing, were the BOQs

 3 12:07:13   provided as part of the contract?

 4 12:07:14.  I believe they were.

 5 12:07:16.  Okay.  Now, looking at the quantities which were

 6 12:07:22   provided in the BOQ, could these quantities be

 7 12:07:24   implemented within the 30 months' contract duration?

 8 12:07:29.  They could.  On my analysis I've looked at that.  As

 9 12:07:32   I showed in the presentation earlier, it would have

10 12:07:37   required more equipment to do that, so it would have

11 12:07:39   required two gangs rather than the one gang --

12 12:07:43.  So it could be done?

13 12:07:44.  -- that was planned in rev 0 to do the 514.

14 12:07:49.  Okay.  Have you seen any evidence at the time of

15 12:07:56   contract signing or prior to that, in pre-bid

16 12:07:58   clarifications, where Strabag questioned the contract

17 12:08:03   duration as not being sufficient to execute the BOQ

18 12:08:06   quantities?

19 12:08:07.  I've not seen anything like that, no.

20 12:08:14.  Okay.  Moving on, was there a requirement to provide

21 12:08:21   a works programme in the tender to execute the contract?

22 12:08:28.  A works programme in the tender?

23 12:08:30.  Yes.

24 12:08:31.  Presumably.  I mean I can't say, I've not looked at the

25 12:08:36   tender documents.  I know a tender programme was


                                      79






 1 12:08:38   provided.  As to whether it was a requirement of the

 2 12:08:41   tender, I can't say.

 3 12:08:44.  So you confirm that you've not seen the tender, right?

 4 12:08:47.  I've seen the tender programme.  And I've seen the

 5 12:08:51   tender method statement.

 6 12:08:52.  Okay.  So can we go to that?  I refer you to exhibit

 7 12:08:56   RSD-1-48, which is also at R12, which is a signed works

 8 12:09:03   contract.  If we could go to volume 3, section 7H part

 9 12:09:10   3, page 33, which is right on your screen, Mr Cookson.

10 12:09:19   You see this form, 4.6.3, specifically talks about

11 12:09:24   a work plan and the programme, right?

12 12:09:26.  I see that, yes.

13 12:09:27.  And now in this section, 4.6.3.2 specifically requires

14 12:09:35   Strabag to provide a programme for completing the works

15 12:09:38   in accordance with the stated time of completion; you

16 12:09:40   see that?

17 12:09:41.  I see that.

18 12:09:43.  Then you agree that Strabag referred its method

19 12:09:45   statement to satisfy this requirement?

20 12:09:50.  I'm sorry, I didn't catch that?

21 12:09:52.  Strabag here in answer says:

22 12:09:55       "Please refer to [the following sections] of the

23 12:10:00   attached Method Statement ..."

24 12:10:03.  Yes.

25 12:10:06.  Now in the next one, 4.6.33, you see that the employer


                                      80






 1 12:10:09   required a critical milestone bar chart which says

 2 12:10:14   schedule of execution representing construction time, or

 3 12:10:16   any other information?

 4 12:10:18.  I see that.

 5 12:10:19.  Then Strabag referred to its attached critical milestone

 6 12:10:26   bar chart and method statement; do you see that?

 7 12:10:31.  Yes.

 8 12:10:31.  Am I right to say that this milestone bar chart was

 9 12:10:34   a representation of the construction programme as

10 12:10:36   required under 4.6.3.2 which we referred to?

11 12:10:40.  Yes.

12 12:10:41.  Okay.  And in answer to 4.6.3.2, Strabag relied on its

13 12:10:46   technical proposal method statement in the tender?  We

14 12:10:51   had seen that earlier on.

15 12:10:57.  When you say "relied" on it, I just want to make sure

16 12:11:02   I understand the question.

17 12:11:03.  Okay.  4.6.3.2, they asked Strabag to give an outline of

18 12:11:08   the programme for completing and then it says:

19 12:11:12       "Please refer to [the following sections] of the

20 12:11:14   attached Method Statement ..."

21 12:11:18.  Yes.

22 12:11:19.  So the contractor and the employer both relied on this

23 12:11:23   technical method statement which formed part of the

24 12:11:27   tender to sign the contract?

25 12:11:29.  Yes.


                                      81






 1 12:11:29.  Okay.  Now let's go to the technical method statement

 2 12:11:34   submitted at tender which forms part of the contract.

 3 12:11:36   That is RSD -- the same RSD we're looking at -- 148.

 4 12:11:43   And page 38.  148.  Page 39 of this document I think is

 5 12:11:49   the method statement.

 6 12:11:58HE PRESIDENT:  I'm sorry, what's the number of that

 7 12:11:59   document again?

 8 12:12:04R ATWINE:  RSD-1-48 which is also R12.

 9 12:12:09S DOERRIES:  Which is also?

10 12:12:09R ATWINE:  R12.  Page 39.

11 12:12:11HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.

12 12:12:11       You see that document, Mr Cookson?

13 12:12:13.  I see it.

14 12:12:13.  What is the title of that document?

15 12:12:17.  "Technical proposal.

16 12:12:19       "Method statement."

17 12:12:22.  Okay, when we go to page 45, page 45 of that document,

18 12:12:27   what is the heading of that section, Mr Cookson?

19 12:12:43.  "Scope of Works".

20 12:12:45.  Okay.  As you go down you'll see in the last

21 12:12:50   paragraph of section 1.2, page 45, you'll see that the

22 12:12:57   contractor states that:

23 12:13:00       "... the contractor has allowed in his bid the works

24 12:13:03   (by nature and quantity) specifically required as per

25 12:13:09   bill of quantities and all those additional works and


                                      82






 1 12:13:11   costs derived from his contract obligations."

 2 12:13:14       You see that?

 3 12:13:19.  I see that, yes.

 4 12:13:20.  So you agree that Strabag's bid for the works was indeed

 5 12:13:23   for the BOQs or at least allowed for the BOQ quantities;

 6 12:13:27   "yes" or "no"?

 7 12:13:29.  Yes, as I understand it, the bill of quantities had unit

 8 12:13:35   prices against the different items in it, so in that

 9 12:13:41   sense the bid included the bill of quantities.

10 12:13:44   I believe Mr Lorenzo addressed this particular

11 12:13:48   paragraph in his last statement.

12 12:13:54.  So let me get this straight.  So Strabag's bid for the

13 12:13:57   works was for the BOQ quantities, or at least it allowed

14 12:14:00   BOQ quantities, from reading this?

15 12:14:02.  The summation of the prices in the bill of quantities

16 12:14:09   was based on the bill items in that bill of quantities.

17 12:14:16   I'm not a quantity surveyor, but that's my

18 12:14:19   understanding.  I don't want to give the wrong

19 12:14:22   impression.

20 12:14:23.  So from your understanding, Strabag's tender submission

21 12:14:31   was specifically for the BOQ, by nature and quantities,

22 12:14:34   from what we are reading here?  Nature and quantities?

23 12:14:45.  The bill of quantities was priced.

24 12:14:46.  No, that's not the question I'm asking you.  I'm asking

25 12:14:49   you --


                                      83






 1 12:14:49.  Well, because -- (overspeaking) --

 2 12:14:49.  -- that Strabag allowed this bid by nature and quantity?

 3 12:14:52.  There's obviously a distinction between how Strabag view

 4 12:14:57   the scope of works by reference to the design drawings,

 5 12:15:01   so.  The bid also included, as I understand it,

 6 12:15:08   Strabag's proposal for undertaking 514,200 odd metres

 7 12:15:16   cubed of G7 within the 30 months period and not the bill

 8 12:15:19   of quantities amount of 883.

 9 12:15:22       That's why I'm just trying to be careful how

10 12:15:27   I answer the question because I don't want to mislead.

11 12:15:31   So, I'm not a quantity surveyor, I don't know exactly

12 12:15:35   how you characterise the bid in terms of the bill of

13 12:15:39   quantities, but my understanding is all of the bill

14 12:15:43   items have bill rates to them and then the quantities

15 12:15:48   are multiplied by that to give you ultimately a bid

16 12:15:51   price.

17 12:15:51.  Okay.  But you admit that this is a technical proposal?

18 12:15:55   The section we are looking at?

19 12:15:58.  It says here the pricing of the bill of quantities.

20 12:16:00.  What we are studying right now is the technical

21 12:16:02   proposal, not the financial --

22 12:16:03.  The method statement, yes.

23 12:16:04.  This is -- yes, this is technical proposal and it's

24 12:16:06   about scope of works, okay?

25 12:16:12.  (Nods head).


                                      84






 1 12:16:12.  Okay, so let's move on.

 2 12:16:15       Now, as per the tender programme, or at least the

 3 12:16:22   critical milestone bar chart, which was a representation

 4 12:16:25   of the programme of works, at page 37 of this critical

 5 12:16:33   milestone bar chart, what was the duration that Strabag

 6 12:16:36   declared to complete these works?

 7 12:16:40.  This I believe is over the 30 months.

 8 12:16:42.  Okay.  So that means that Strabag signed a contract and

 9 12:16:48   undertook to complete the works, as we saw earlier, by

10 12:16:52   nature, quantity, specifically as per the BOQ, within

11 12:16:57   a duration of 30 months?

12 12:17:00.  Well, as I said earlier, as I understand it, Strabag's

13 12:17:10   tender was based on this programme performing its

14 12:17:17   measurement of the tender drawings.  So for G7 fill, for

15 12:17:22   example, Strabag's measurement of the tender drawings

16 12:17:24   was 514,200 I think, or 514,400 metres cube, so the

17 12:17:32   activity on here for placing G7 fill, as I understand

18 12:17:35   it, represents performing that quantity of work, not the

19 12:17:40   bill quantity of 883,715.

20 12:17:49HE PRESIDENT:  Just going back to something said earlier,

21 12:17:51   Mr Cookson, is it your understanding that that was

22 12:17:53   visible in the tender, ie that the programme was

23 12:17:55   a programme to effectively do 500,000 odd tonnes(sic) of

24 12:18:01   works as opposed to BOQ quantities?

25 12:18:05.  No, there's nothing in the programme that tells you what


                                      85






 1 12:18:08   is in that programme activity other than --

 2 12:18:10HE PRESIDENT:  Was there anything else in the tender that

 3 12:18:12   would tell --

 4 12:18:12.  Can I just finish that --

 5 12:18:14HE PRESIDENT:  Hold on.  Was there anything else in the

 6 12:18:15   tender that would tell an independent objective reader

 7 12:18:19   of the tender that the programme and/or the price being

 8 12:18:23   put forward was based on undertaking a smaller quantity

 9 12:18:26   of works than the BOQ?

10 12:18:29.  Not on my reading, but if you look at this programme, if

11 12:18:33   you can scroll to the G7 -- yes, the highlighted

12 12:18:41   activity at row 33.  So this is within a section of the

13 12:18:47   programme dealing with construction of the main road, so

14 12:18:49   it says:

15 12:18:50       "Earthworks - fill (G7-G15)."

16 12:18:58       So that would suggest to me that the activity in

17 12:19:00   there is planning to construct the road layers in the

18 12:19:05   main road.  And Strabag measured the quantity of the

19 12:19:16   road layers in the main road from the drawings.

20 12:19:22       So that's how I would read the programme.  It's not

21 12:19:26   just a general allowance for G7 fill across the project.

22 12:19:29   It's specifically included in the programme to -- as

23 12:19:33   part of the construction of the main road.

24 12:19:39       But beyond that, there's no other indication as to

25 12:19:44   what is included within that activity duration that I've


                                      86






 1 12:19:48   seen so far.

 2 12:19:49R ATWINE:  Okay?

 3 12:20:02S DOERRIES:  Sorry, just help me.  You have:

 4 12:20:03       "Earthworks - fill (G7-G15)."

 5 12:20:08       Then I see the dates.  Then in-between that,

 6 12:20:10   I can't -- is it 510, is that a "t" or --

 7 12:20:13.  I'm not sure why it says "t", but that's actually the

 8 12:20:16   duration in working days.  So it's 510 working days.

 9 12:20:20S DOERRIES:  Okay, thank you.

10 12:20:27R ATWINE:  Okay?  Mr President?  Can I proceed?

11 12:20:31HE PRESIDENT:  Of course you can.  I apologise, yes.

12 12:20:36R ATWINE:  So this document also talks about rock fill and

13 12:20:41   cut to spoil.

14 12:20:43.  Yes.

15 12:20:45.  And from my reading, the rock fill and cut to spoil

16 12:20:54   would have to be executed concurrently, that is in

17 12:21:00   parallel; is that correct?

18 12:21:23.  Maybe if you could just zoom out a little bit, just to

19 12:21:31   get the full length of the bars on the screen, would be

20 12:21:34   helpful.

21 12:21:42       It shows earthworks G7 and G15 with rock fill

22 12:21:49   undertaken partially at the same time with that bar.

23 12:21:53.  Yes.

24 12:21:56.  Which shows common excavation to swamp overlapping,

25 12:22:02   starting slightly earlier, but overlapping for the


                                      87






 1 12:22:05   majority of that.

 2 12:22:06.  Yes.

 3 12:22:08.  Earthworks, rock excavation is also overlapping with the

 4 12:22:16   G7 to G15.

 5 12:22:18.  So these activities were supposed to be done

 6 12:22:21   concurrently, in short, over a long period of time?

 7 12:22:23.  Well, overlapping, yes, not fully concurrently.

 8 12:22:26.  Okay.  Now let's move on.  When you look at G7,

 9 12:22:30   earthworks G7, like you have just stated earlier on, it

10 12:22:34   was supposed to be completed in 161 days or 510,

11 12:22:40   according to you.  Do you see that?  Line 33?

12 12:22:48.  Yes.  510 working days.

13 12:22:53.  So, if the BOQ quantity is 883,715 -- you agree with me

14 12:22:57   that that is the quantity in the BOQ?

15 12:23:01.  That is the quantity in the bill of quantities, yes.

16 12:23:04.  Okay.  So let's assume -- now, when we look at this

17 12:23:09   tender programme, which as we earlier saw was based on

18 12:23:12   the BOQ quantities, the production rate for G7 would be

19 12:23:21   1,820 cubic metres per day?

20 12:23:27.  I can't do the maths in my head, but I'll take your word

21 12:23:30   for it, if that's 510 divided into 883,715.  If this

22 12:23:35   activity represents that volume of -- that BQ volume.

23 12:23:45.  1,820 per day?

24 12:23:47.  As I say, I'll take your word for it --

25 12:23:49.  That would be the production rate.


                                      88






 1 12:23:50.  -- but --

 2 12:23:50.  That would be the production rate.

 3 12:23:50.  -- I can't do the maths in my head.

 4 12:23:53.  Okay.  If you want, we can put up the calculation, but

 5 12:23:56   let's not go there.

 6 12:23:58.  I think actually from memory I calculated something

 7 12:24:00   slightly different, about 1,700 -- (overspeaking) --

 8 12:24:04.  1,732 cubic metres per day?

 9 12:24:10.  That rings a bell, divided by 510.  I think Mr Singhal

10 12:24:13   used a slightly shorter duration for the working days

11 12:24:19   when -- I think he may have calculated the 1,800 figure

12 12:24:24   that you referenced.

13 12:24:26.  Okay.  And the production rate which Strabag has

14 12:24:29   considered was 812 cubic metres per working day?

15 12:24:36.  That's the average across phase one and phase two.

16 12:24:39.  And do you agree that this is much lower than these

17 12:24:43   production rates which we have just seen here?

18 12:24:46.  Well, you're comparing two different things.  PoIT rev 0

19 12:24:52   is a programme to deliver 514,911 metres cubed and you

20 12:24:58   are putting to me a production rate based on the tender

21 12:25:02   programme on the basis that it is for performing

22 12:25:07   883,715.

23 12:25:10.  So looking at these two different production rates like

24 12:25:14   you state, the one of Strabag is lower?  The 812 is

25 12:25:20   lower?


                                      89






 1 12:25:21.  Well, if you divide 510 by 514,911, you'll get a lower

 2 12:25:30   rate than 1,800.

 3 12:25:33.  Okay, very good.  Now, the rate which was considered by

 4 12:25:36   UNRA in administrative order number 10, do you remember

 5 12:25:39   that rate?

 6 12:25:42.  I think it was about 1,400, from memory.

 7 12:25:47.  1,473?

 8 12:25:48.  Yes.

 9 12:25:49.  Okay.  So this would also be higher than what Strabag is

10 12:25:57   considering?

11 12:26:02.  Your assessment of 510 divided by 883 is higher than

12 12:26:09   what UNRA used in its second EOT award; is that the

13 12:26:15   question?

14 12:26:16.  I'm asking whether the rate that was used by Strabag of

15 12:26:19   812 is lower than UNRA's rate of 1,473 in administrative

16 12:26:28   order number 10?

17 12:26:29.  It is lower, but in the first EOT award of course UNRA

18 12:26:33   used 812.25, which is almost identical to Strabag's

19 12:26:38   planned production rate.

20 12:26:40.  Yes, I'm talking about administrative order number 10.

21 12:26:44.  Yes, so the second EOT.

22 12:26:48.  So, now assuming the production rate which Strabag

23 12:26:54   allegedly derived from the drawings like you said

24 12:26:56   earlier, if we are to look at the figure which they

25 12:26:59   derived from the drawings, that is 514,911; is that


                                      90






 1 12:27:04   correct?

 2 12:27:06.  Yes.

 3 12:27:10.  If you are to derive a production rate for G7 based on

 4 12:27:13   the number of days for which G7 was supposed to be

 5 12:27:18   executed in this critical milestone bar chart, that is

 6 12:27:23   514,911 divided by the 616 days?

 7 12:27:33.  Well, what's the 616 days?

 8 12:27:37.  That is the period for earthworks from --

 9 12:27:41.  Okay.  Well, I mean you're comparing different things

10 12:27:44   there.  So the productivity, those production rates, is

11 12:27:48   what can be achieved in a working day.

12 12:27:51.  Okay.

13 12:27:51.  So if you use calendar day periods --

14 12:27:54.  Okay.

15 12:27:54.  -- then you're going to be including within that days

16 12:27:57   when no work is being undertaken so you'll get the wrong

17 12:28:01   production rate.

18 12:28:01.  Okay, so let's do the computation for the working day

19 12:28:04   then.  If it is 616 working days, if you can calculate

20 12:28:10   that, please?

21 12:28:11.  510 working days -- (overspeaking) --

22 12:28:13.  Okay, we can use yours, yes.

23 12:28:14.  -- the programme.

24 12:28:14.  So here we have 514,911.  Then we divide it by 510.

25 12:28:32.  Yes.


                                      91






 1 12:28:32.  So that gives us a rate of 1,009.

 2 12:28:37.  Yes, I see that.

 3 12:28:38.  Is that correct?

 4 12:28:39.  Yes.

 5 12:28:40.  So this rate would still be higher?

 6 12:28:46.  Higher than the 800 in PoIT rev 0.

 7 12:28:50.  Yes, okay, very well.

 8 12:28:52       Have you seen any evidence in the tender which shows

 9 12:28:56   that the tender was based on the 514,911?

10 12:29:05.  No, nothing beyond what I explained earlier, that it

11 12:29:10   just seems to me that this activity for earthworks fill,

12 12:29:14   G7 and 15, is there to represent construction of the

13 12:29:17   main road.  And the tender drawings, as measured by

14 12:29:20   Strabag, have a figure of 514,000 for G7 fill in the

15 12:29:24   main road.  So that's the only kind of link that I've

16 12:29:29   seen.  There's no direct written explanation of that.

17 12:29:34.  So as an expert, in reviewing all the evidence available

18 12:29:38   to you, you did not see a figure of 514,911?  In the

19 12:29:44   tender documents?

20 12:29:45.  In the tender?  Well, I know that Strabag measured the

21 12:29:50   tender drawings at 514,400.

22 12:29:55.  I'm referring to the tender documents, which were

23 12:29:59   present at the time of signing the contract.  Did you in

24 12:30:02   your review of all that evidence ever come across this

25 12:30:04   figure anywhere?


                                      92






 1 12:30:08.  In its tender proposal?  No.

 2 12:30:10.  Okay, very well.

 3 12:30:12       Now I would like to go to a different topic, that is

 4 12:30:16   the production rates under Table D.

 5 12:30:20       In the first joint statement at page 149, you agree

 6 12:30:34   that Table D -- you agree with Mr Singhal that the

 7 12:30:42   production rates in Table D for G7 is 4,250 cubic metres

 8 12:30:52   per day, based on a working day of 8.5 working hours,

 9 12:30:56   right?

10 12:30:57.  Yes, I agree with the mathematics is all I'm saying

11 12:31:00   there.

12 12:31:00.  Yes.  You agree that this is the correct production

13 12:31:09   rate?

14 12:31:09.  No, I don't agree with that.

15 12:31:13.  So you're saying that Strabag made an error and included

16 12:31:18   an erroneous production rate in Table D?

17 12:31:23.  Certainly an inconsistency.  I mean, Table D includes

18 12:31:27   productivity rates -- well, as you see there,

19 12:31:30   0.002 hours, which is obviously not a unit of

20 12:31:34   measurement for planning an earthworks project.  So to

21 12:31:38   my mind, the production rates that Strabag intended are

22 12:31:43   those that are shown in its PoIT rev 0 programme and

23 12:31:47   shown in the accompanying method statement, which are

24 12:31:53   declared production rates rather than calculated rates

25 12:31:56   based on these fractions of an hour.


                                      93






 1 12:32:02.  Mr Cookson --

 2 12:32:03.  And Table D is also in -- it's a pricing document.  It's

 3 12:32:08   in the part of the contract that deals with price.

 4 12:32:14   So --

 5 12:32:15.  Okay.

 6 12:32:15.  -- I know that it's inconsistent with the programme and

 7 12:32:18   the method statement, but in my view those two documents

 8 12:32:25   are more representative of what Strabag planned to do in

 9 12:32:28   delivering the project than this computation of the

10 12:32:33   fractions in Table D.

11 12:32:36.  But you also acknowledge that PoIT rev 0 was not in

12 12:32:40   existence at the time they signed this contract,

13 12:32:43   correct?

14 12:32:43.  Correct.

15 12:32:44.  Okay.  So let's go to the technical proposal method

16 12:32:48   statement, which was submitted at tender.  Technical

17 12:32:53   proposal method statement which we had earlier looked

18 12:32:56   at, exhibit RSD-1-48.  Page 95.

19 12:33:07       Page 95 of that document.  You see that, Mr Cookson?

20 12:33:20   The part that's highlighted says:

21 12:33:23       "In case of ..."

22 12:33:25       The heading is, "Roadworks Production rates"?

23 12:33:29.  I see that, yes.

24 12:33:30.  And it says:

25 12:33:30       "In case of discrepancies between this information


                                      94






 1 12:33:32   and the production rates inferred from the attached BOQ,

 2 12:33:36   Table D) of Volume 4.3.5 of the Programme of Works,

 3 12:33:42   these last three documents will prevail."

 4 12:33:44       You see that, Mr Cookson?

 5 12:33:45.  I see that, yes.

 6 12:33:48.  So the technical proposal method statement instructs the

 7 12:33:55   parties to follow Table D to infer production rates, as

 8 12:33:57   one of the prevailing sources of production rates?

 9 12:34:00.  Yes, and the programme of works.

10 12:34:04.  And you also agree that Table D provides a production

11 12:34:07   rate of 442 cubic metres per day for rock fill?

12 12:34:14.  Yes.

13 12:34:16.  Okay.

14 12:34:18.  On that calculation, yes, I agree with that.

15 12:34:24.  Okay, so let's move on.

16 12:34:26HE PRESIDENT:  Just before we move on.

17 12:34:27       Mr Cookson, a second ago when the -- just to

18 12:34:30   clarify.  Just a second ago, you were asked a question:

19 12:34:36       "So the technical proposal method statement

20 12:34:39   instructs the parties to follow Table D ... as one of

21 12:34:42   the prevailing sources of production rates?"

22 12:34:46       And your answer was:

23 12:34:47       "Yes, and the programme of works."

24 12:34:49       The programme of works you were referring to there

25 12:34:51   was the programme that went with the tender that we


                                      95






 1 12:34:54   looked at a little second ago?

 2 12:34:56.  Yes.  That would be the tender programme in this

 3 12:35:00   instance.

 4 12:35:04HE PRESIDENT:  Taking that tender programme that we looked

 5 12:35:07   at a little second ago, and the attached bill of

 6 12:35:14   quantities together, what do you say, as an independent

 7 12:35:19   expert, the production rates -- what production rates

 8 12:35:22   should be inferred from taking those documents together?

 9 12:35:32.  So are you asking about the 510 working days and the

10 12:35:35   883 --

11 12:35:36HE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm not, I'm --

12 12:35:37.  I'm just trying to put the two threads together.

13 12:35:39HE PRESIDENT:  Look at the document on the screen, it says:

14 12:35:42       "In case of discrepancies between this information

15 12:35:45   and the production rates inferred from the attached BOQ,

16 12:35:49   Table D) ... or the Programme of Works ..."

17 12:35:55       Leave aside Table D for a second because I have your

18 12:35:58   point about that.  Or we might bring it back into the

19 12:36:02   equation in a second.  But what do you say should be the

20 12:36:06   production rates that one would, as an independent

21 12:36:09   observer of the tender, infer from the attached bill of

22 12:36:14   quantity and the programme of works?

23 12:36:17.  Well, I would say the programme of works, because that's

24 12:36:21   the plan to deliver the projects.

25 12:36:26HE PRESIDENT:  I'll ask the question once more.  What do


                                      96






 1 12:36:28   you say are the production rates that an independent

 2 12:36:30   observer of the tender going in would infer from the

 3 12:36:35   bill of quantity and the programme of works in the

 4 12:36:37   tender?

 5 12:36:44.  I'm not sure you can infer production rates from the

 6 12:36:47   bill of quantities or from the programme.  You would

 7 12:36:50   have to do some calculations to arrive at a production

 8 12:36:53   rate.

 9 12:36:54HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  So what calculation would you do if

10 12:36:56   you had the bill of quantities and the programme that

11 12:36:58   went with the tender?

12 12:37:01.  Well, if you were planning to place the bill of quantity

13 12:37:05   amount of G7, which is the 883, you would divide

14 12:37:10   510 days by that to work out a production rate.

15 12:37:15HE PRESIDENT:  I'm worried I led you into that answer

16 12:37:18   a little bit.  I'll ask it more widely.

17 12:37:20       If you had received the tender and you were

18 12:37:23   independent and you had read section 14.1 and you saw

19 12:37:27   the words, "the production rates inferred from the

20 12:37:30   attached bill of quantity, Table D in the programme of

21 12:37:34   works", what are the productions rates that you would

22 12:37:37   have inferred?

23 12:37:39.  Well, this -- I believe we're looking at Strabag's

24 12:37:44   method statement here, so it's their proposal, so what

25 12:37:49   I would infer from it is the production rates that are


                                      97






 1 12:37:53   expressed in that document together with the programme,

 2 12:37:56   rather than Table D.  Because Table D is a pricing

 3 12:38:00   document, whereas the method statement and the programme

 4 12:38:02   deal with Strabag's planning, its proposal, its planning

 5 12:38:07   proposal for delivering the tender.

 6 12:38:12HE PRESIDENT:  This technical proposal is the proposal that

 7 12:38:13   goes with the tender, isn't it?

 8 12:38:15.  Yes.  But it's written by Strabag.

 9 12:38:18HE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.

10 12:38:22       I have your evidence that you don't think Table D is

11 12:38:24   very helpful because of what you call the Swiss clock

12 12:38:29   nature of what you would have to do.  I have that

13 12:38:31   evidence.

14 12:38:32.  Mm.

15 12:38:33HE PRESIDENT:  But reading this technical proposal and what

16 12:38:35   it says -- and perhaps if we go back again to that

17 12:38:38   sentence, the sentence at 14.1.  It says:

18 12:39:00       "In case of discrepancies between this information

19 12:39:04   and the production rates inferred from the attached

20 12:39:08   [bill of quantity], Table D) ... or the Programme of

21 12:39:15   Works, these last three documents [which I understand to

22 12:39:18   be the Table D and the programme of works] will

23 12:39:22   prevail."

24 12:39:23       What do you say somebody receiving this document in

25 12:39:27   the tender and the rest of those -- the three documents


                                      98






 1 12:39:30   that were referred to, what do you say they would have

 2 12:39:34   inferred as the production rates from those documents?

 3 12:39:39.  Well, the only -- of those three, the only document that

 4 12:39:44   has anything to do with actual production rates is the

 5 12:39:48   Table D.

 6 12:39:51HE PRESIDENT:  Right, but you tell us that that would be

 7 12:39:53   discounted.

 8 12:39:56.  (Nods).

 9 12:39:56HE PRESIDENT:  I'm slightly surprised that you're not

10 12:39:58   saying to me: I would infer that the production rate you

11 12:40:02   get is you divide the bill of quantity amounts by

12 12:40:05   the days in which you have to do it.  You don't think

13 12:40:09   that?

14 12:40:18.  That would be one interpretation.  But I believe that

15 12:40:20   would also produce different figures than the

16 12:40:23   calculation we just looked at that's worked out from

17 12:40:26   Table D, so.

18 12:40:27HE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.

19 12:40:27.  I mean, the difficulty is there are inconsistencies

20 12:40:30   between different possible ways of interpreting that.

21 12:40:38HE PRESIDENT:  Right.  Have you got any evidence you want

22 12:40:40   to give me as to what you say a reasonable person

23 12:40:43   looking at these documents would infer as the production

24 12:40:46   rates?

25 12:40:56.  Well, I think somebody receiving this tender would


                                      99






 1 12:41:00   probably look at the programme and then infer production

 2 12:41:05   rates based on what is shown in that programme.  And

 3 12:41:12   I know there's a difference between the parties on that.

 4 12:41:19HE PRESIDENT:  What inference do you -- do you want to

 5 12:41:22   offer me any evidence as to what inference you think

 6 12:41:25   they would take from that, in terms of figures?

 7 12:41:36.  I'm not sure, to be honest.

 8 12:41:38HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

 9 12:41:40.  I think -- well, I know from Mr Muleme's evidence that

10 12:41:43   he included a breakdown of the 883 in his witness

11 12:41:48   statement so it's composed, the 883,000 metres cubed of

12 12:41:54   G7, so it's composed of different components.  One of

13 12:41:57   those components is an assessment of the quantities

14 12:42:00   required to deliver the road, which is what I believe is

15 12:42:04   shown on the tender programme, not those other

16 12:42:07   components; and Strabag's position is that it measured

17 12:42:12   the drawings that came with the tender --

18 12:42:15HE PRESIDENT:  I'm not asking about either side's

19 12:42:18   positions.

20 12:42:18.  Yes, no, I'm just saying --

21 12:42:18HE PRESIDENT:  What I'm asking you is --

22 12:42:19.  -- it's not an easy thing to say, what would you infer.

23 12:42:26HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you.

24 12:42:35R ATWINE:  Thank you, Mr President.

25 12:42:35       So Mr Cookson, in summary, the rates which one can


                                     100






 1 12:42:38   derive from Table D and the works programme and the BOQ,

 2 12:42:42   based on this statement, are still higher than what

 3 12:42:45   Strabag applied?

 4 12:42:53.  Yes, I believe they were all higher.

 5 12:42:55.  Okay.  Let's move on.

 6 12:42:57       Now, regarding the quantity variation between the

 7 12:43:03   quantities derived from the tender drawings versus the

 8 12:43:06   BOQ, did you come across any enquiry or declaration at

 9 12:43:13   the time of tender submission highlighting the quantity

10 12:43:16   variance in the BOQ and the tender drawings?

11 12:43:23.  Are you asking me did Strabag make it known that there

12 12:43:26   was a difference between --

13 12:43:27.  Yes.

14 12:43:28.  Not that I've seen.

15 12:43:29.  Okay.  It's not.  So, the contract amount in this

16 12:43:37   contract, how was it arrived at?

17 12:43:42.  Well, as far as I know, adding up all of the individual

18 12:43:47   items to arrive at a number at the bottom.

19 12:43:51.  In the BOQ, right?

20 12:43:52.  That's my understanding.

21 12:43:53.  Okay.  Now let's go back to the method statement, RSD --

22 12:44:00   the PoIT rev 0 method statement, which is exhibit

23 12:44:03   RSD-1-01.  Page 8.

24 12:44:23       Mr Cookson, this is the method statement that

25 12:44:26   Strabag submitted together with revision 0 of its


                                     101






 1 12:44:31   programme of implementation of tasks, and at page 8 of

 2 12:44:34   this general method statement, it states that:

 3 12:44:37       "The duration of the activities in the submitted

 4 12:44:42   Programme of Works (as well as in any future version) is

 5 12:44:45   based on the quantities that are currently expected to

 6 12:44:47   be executed after the Contractor's examination of the

 7 12:44:50   design drawings received with the Contract, which in

 8 12:44:55   some cases may not necessarily match the estimated

 9 12:44:58   quantities set out in the BOQ.  However, (despite

10 12:45:03   quantity variances), the Contractor considers that the

11 12:45:06   contract amount will be expended within the 30 month

12 12:45:10   duration."

13 12:45:10       You see that?

14 12:45:14.  I see that, yes.

15 12:45:14.  So here Strabag is acknowledging there is a variance,

16 12:45:18   there could be a variance; right?

17 12:45:22.  Yes.

18 12:45:22.  Okay.  And do you see that in the last line of this

19 12:45:27   paragraph, while acknowledging the quantity variance

20 12:45:29   with the BOQ, Strabag still says that the 30 months'

21 12:45:33   duration would be sufficient to expend the contract

22 12:45:38   amount?

23 12:45:39.  Yes.

24 12:45:41.  So, in other words, the claimant is ready to expend the

25 12:45:46   contract amount derived from the BOQ but without


                                     102






 1 12:45:49   executing the BOQ quantities?

 2 12:45:55.  Sorry, I didn't catch your last -- (overspeaking) --

 3 12:45:56.  I'm saying that, in other words, if I was to put it in

 4 12:45:58   another way, the claimant was ready to expend the

 5 12:46:02   contract amount which is derived from the BOQ

 6 12:46:04   quantities, but without executing the BOQ quantities?

 7 12:46:10       That's what it says?

 8 12:46:12.  Yes.

 9 12:46:16.  Good.  Let's move on to another topic, which is on

10 12:46:19   section 4, which I'm sure you're very familiar with.

11 12:46:21   Let's look about section 4.  Let's open Mr Singhal's

12 12:46:25   first report at page 59 where we have a bar chart, the

13 12:46:38   same bar chart which you used in your presentation,

14 12:46:41   which I'm sure you agree with.

15 12:46:42       Page 59.  You see that?

16 12:46:57.  I see that, yes.

17 12:46:58.  You used this in your presentation.

18 12:47:00       So let's focus on section 3.  You see section 3

19 12:47:04   there?  The completion date for G7 layer was

20 12:47:14   11 September 2021; you see that?

21 12:47:16.  I see that, yes.

22 12:47:16.  And then when you go down to section 4, the start date

23 12:47:21   for G7 layer was 11 August 2021.  You see that?

24 12:47:24.  I see that.

25 12:47:27.  So as per Strabag's plan, section 4 G7 could be started


                                     103






 1 12:47:33   before the completion of section 3; is that correct?

 2 12:47:36.  Yes, that is the one-month overlap that I referenced in

 3 12:47:38   my presentation this morning.

 4 12:47:44.  Let's now see the reason why Strabag could not commence

 5 12:47:49   section 4.  Let's open exhibit RSD-1-49, which is

 6 12:48:03   Strabag's monthly programme report.  You see on this

 7 12:48:07   page here it says:

 8 12:48:09       "Works beyond [kilometre] 30+500 pending

 9 12:48:16   formalisation of administrative order."

10 12:48:18       You see that, Mr Cookson?

11 12:48:19.  I see that.

12 12:48:20.  And we all know that the works starting from kilometre

13 12:48:23   30+500, that is section 4, right, phase two?

14 12:48:28.  Correct.

15 12:48:28.  Is there anything mentioned here that resources were not

16 12:48:31   available for works beyond kilometre 30+500?  Have you

17 12:48:35   come across anything in this monthly progress report?

18 12:48:44.  I think that's probably true.  I mean, I don't recall --

19 12:48:50.  So let's open exhibit C-093, which is the SR's letter

20 12:48:58   dated 6 October to Strabag.

21 12:49:00       In this letter, if we can go down, you can see that

22 12:49:05   the SR was expressing serious concerns on Strabag's

23 12:49:10   abandonment of phase two works.  You can see here the

24 12:49:18   supervisor is saying that, he's noting:

25 12:49:19       "... the Contractor has not commenced on


                                     104






 1 12:49:25   implementation of permanent works along ... (Olia-Umi

 2 12:49:25   Landing), despite some progress on the first road

 3 12:49:25   section ... leaving the road section II not attended

 4 12:49:31   to ..."

 5 12:49:32       Then he goes on to say:

 6 12:49:33       "We therefore notify all the contractual entities

 7 12:49:36   that the Contractor's continuous failure to start

 8 12:49:38   permanent works ... is likely to derail the project ..."

 9 12:49:42       You can see all that?

10 12:49:43.  Yes, I can see that.

11 12:49:45.  Let's see Strabag's reply to this serious concern.

12 12:49:47   I request you to open exhibit C-094.  This is a letter

13 12:49:56   from Strabag, sir, where they are taking note of the

14 12:50:02   SR's letter stated above and his concern that works were

15 12:50:05   not yet commencing in phase two.

16 12:50:08       Then the contractor goes on to note, if you could go

17 12:50:12   down, it says that:

18 12:50:20       "... works are put on hold until the necessary

19 12:50:23   Administration Order is ... issued."

20 12:50:24       Then it says:

21 12:50:25       "... the reason for the delay lies in the change in

22 12:50:29   design and the missing Administration Order to proceed

23 12:50:32   into Phase II."

24 12:50:33       You see that, Mr Cookson?

25 12:50:34.  I see that, yes.


                                     105






 1 12:50:35.  Nowhere in this letter does Strabag say that the delay

 2 12:50:38   is due to non-commencement or availability of resources

 3 12:50:43   as you state in your report; am I correct?

 4 12:50:45.  It doesn't say that in the letter, no.

 5 12:50:48.  Now let me open exhibit RSD-2-45.  That's the one.  If

 6 12:50:56   we go up we can see the date.  This is a letter from

 7 12:51:00   Eptisa dated 9 September to Strabag.

 8 12:51:09       Now we go to paragraph 3 of this letter where it

 9 12:51:12   says:

10 12:51:13       "Contractor has no contractual basis to suspend work

11 12:51:16   on any part or whole of the project road entirely

12 12:51:19   possessed since 30th October 2020 - thus unilateral

13 12:51:25   suspension of works along ... section 2 ... is not

14 12:51:29   acceptable and unwarranted as contractor is free to seek

15 12:51:32   all contractual means to address any concern without

16 12:51:35   being seen to derail the project progress ..."

17 12:51:37       You see that, Mr Cookson?

18 12:51:39.  I see that, yes.

19 12:51:40.  Now let's see Strabag's response to this, exhibit

20 12:51:43   RSD-2-46.

21 12:52:00       You see here Strabag is saying:

22 12:52:04       "No contractual basis to suspend - comment refuted.

23 12:52:07   The Contractor has full rights to invoke Article 38.3,

24 12:52:10   despite not yet taking this action.  It is presumed that

25 12:52:13   your comment is in response to POIT Activity 200


                                     106






 1 12:52:20   'Phase II - Works on Hold'.  As advised in our notice of

 2 12:52:24   dispute letter dated 13.08.2021 the Contractor cannot

 3 12:52:28   perform as required by Article 37.7 following the SR

 4 12:52:31   failure to provide an Administrative Order (signed by

 5 12:52:34   Supervisor) for revised ... drawings indicated changed

 6 12:52:39   line and level for all design changes between [those

 7 12:52:41   kilometres]."

 8 12:52:43       You see that?

 9 12:52:44.  I see that.

10 12:52:44.  Here Strabag is stating the reason for non-commencement

11 12:52:48   is the pending administrative order signed by the

12 12:52:52   supervisor; am I right?

13 12:52:54.  Yes, there's no doubt that Strabag were pursuing

14 12:52:56   an administrative order before it started phase two.

15 12:52:58.  Okay.  Let's see Strabag's position on 3 January,

16 12:53:01   exhibit C-233.

17 12:53:07       This is in relation to the request for

18 12:53:11   administrative order.  This is from Strabag to Eptisa

19 12:53:13   and you can see on page 2 of this letter, if you can

20 12:53:20   read paragraph 5 where it says that:

21 12:53:23       "This statement has now been proven incorrect, and

22 12:53:27   vindicates our apprehension to proceed with these works

23 12:53:30   beyond km 30+500 based on the SR's instruction.  The

24 12:53:35   manner in which the SR is randomly amending the design

25 12:53:38   is not acceptable and causing the contractor substantial


                                     107






 1 12:53:41   disruption.  We submitted, in good faith, execution

 2 12:53:43   drawings for the second time for the section between km

 3 12:53:46   30+500 to 35+00, only to find these are again obsolete

 4 12:53:53   considering the information provided within the final

 5 12:53:56   design review."

 6 12:53:57       Mr Cookson, does this document say they did not

 7 12:54:02   start works because of the administrative order?

 8 12:54:16.  Well, it talks about Strabag's apprehension and the

 9 12:54:23   reasons for pursuing the administrative order.  I'm not

10 12:54:25   sure what the -- where it says, "This statement has now

11 12:54:30   been proven incorrect", I'm not quite sure what --

12 12:54:34R GILLION:  Would it be useful to scroll up so the witness

13 12:54:36   can see the entirety of the letter in this context?

14 12:54:39R ATWINE:  Sure.

15 12:54:40R GILLION:  Thank you very much.

16 12:54:53R ATWINE:  No problem.

17 12:55:07.  I don't want to see all the references, just ...

18 12:55:17   (Pause).

19 12:55:17       Okay, thank you.  Thank you.

20 12:55:28       Yes, so I think the letter is saying that the

21 12:55:32   revised -- or approval of the phase two line and level

22 12:55:38   design changes that was communicated on 20 December 2021

23 12:55:43   with the supervisor's approval, since the issue of those

24 12:55:49   drawings, I believe Strabag is saying in this letter

25 12:55:52   that it's found further inconsistencies or changes.


                                     108






 1 12:55:59.  So my question is --

 2 12:56:01.  And it's saying that that's the reason, if you like,

 3 12:56:03   that it was apprehensive in terms of starting phase two

 4 12:56:07   without the administrative order.  I mean, of course, in

 5 12:56:11   the end, Strabag did start the works without

 6 12:56:14   an administrative order.

 7 12:56:16.  So in essence -- but we all know that Strabag eventually

 8 12:56:22   started without the administrative order.  So they could

 9 12:56:26   have started even without the administrative order?

10 12:56:29.  Well, they could have started maybe a couple of weeks

11 12:56:34   earlier than it actually did.  I mean, the G7 started,

12 12:56:38   I think, on 19 January 2022.  The phase one works were

13 12:56:42   ongoing up until G7, 6 January 2022, plus there were the

14 12:56:47   upper road layers to be constructed after that in

15 12:56:50   phase one.  So I don't believe there were resources

16 12:56:54   available to start phase two much earlier than the date

17 12:56:59   that it actually did start.

18 12:57:00.  Okay.  I see your point.  But have you seen anything in

19 12:57:04   the correspondences I've taken you through which show

20 12:57:07   that the works did not commence because of lack of

21 12:57:10   resources?

22 12:57:14.  No, I don't believe so.

23 12:57:16R ATWINE:  Okay.

24 12:57:16       Now -- so we can stop there for now, Mr President.

25 12:57:21HE PRESIDENT:  Are you finished with your


                                     109






 1 12:57:22   cross-examination?

 2 12:57:24R ATWINE:  We are done with the cross-examination.

 3 12:57:26HE PRESIDENT:  Is there any re-examination?

 4 12:57:29R GILLION:  Yes, there will be, but probably not on the

 5 12:57:32   spot.

 6 12:57:32HE PRESIDENT:  I see the time.

 7 12:57:33R GILLION:  We would be obliged if we can have the time for

 8 12:57:35   preparing over lunchtime.

 9 12:57:36HE PRESIDENT:  Sure.  So, just so I understand how long we

10 12:57:43   need for lunch, I think you had envisaged taking the

11 12:57:48   afternoon for cross-examination of Mr Singhal.  Would

12 12:57:50   you welcome a slightly shorter lunch to give you time

13 12:57:53   for the re-examination?

14 12:58:12R GILLION:  We would be obliged for a one-hour lunch break,

15 12:58:15   that would be fine for the rest of the afternoon.

16 12:58:17HE PRESIDENT:  Okay, that's fine.

17 12:58:18       It's now about two minutes to 1, so we'll be back --

18 12:58:23   let's come back for 2, but let's do so promptly so we

19 12:58:27   can kick off at 2.

20 12:58:30       You have given evidence enough times, I think, to

21 12:58:33   have probably heard this speech before, Mr Cookson, but

22 12:58:35   of course, given that you're going over lunch, you're

23 12:58:38   not to discuss the case with anybody over lunch, but

24 12:58:43   I suspect you've heard tribunals say that to you before

25 12:58:48   so I won't labour the point.


                                     110






 1 12:58:51.  Thank you.

 2 12:58:5212.58 pm)

 3 12:59:00                (The luncheon adjournment)

 4 01:01:382.00 pm)

 5 02:00:05HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  It's now 2 o'clock, welcome back

 6 02:00:09   everybody.

 7 02:00:09       Mr Gillion, your re-examination.

 8 02:00:13               Re-examination by MR GILLION

 9 02:00:18R GILLION:  Thank you, Mr President.

10 02:00:20       Mr Cookson, good afternoon.  I'm going to ask you

11 02:00:22   a couple of questions in relation to what was put to you

12 02:00:25   this morning by the respondent's counsel.

13 02:00:28       I will start first, I want to maybe show you

14 02:00:33   a document which is the tender method statement that was

15 02:00:37   shown to you; do you remember?

16 02:00:38.  I do, yes.

17 02:00:39.  It's exhibit C-309.  You've been asked in particular

18 02:00:44   whether you had considered tender documents, you

19 02:00:48   confirmed that, in terms of the tender method statement

20 02:00:50   and the tender programmes.  So I'm going to show the

21 02:00:54   tender method statement to you.

22 02:00:58       So we get the tender programme here.  The tender

23 02:01:02   method statement will be shown to you in a second.

24 02:01:09       You were, do you remember, first shown section 1.2

25 02:01:13   of the tender method statement, if you remember?


                                     111






 1 02:01:17.  Yes, I remember.

 2 02:01:20.  Let's look at it.  So you were asked to consider the

 3 02:01:25   final paragraph of that section 1.2.  For the record,

 4 02:01:32   that section is entitled, "Scope of Works" and it was

 5 02:01:37   suggested to you that the final paragraph would indicate

 6 02:01:42   that the scope of work would be defined by the BOQ.

 7 02:01:45       You've given your answer, but I was just wondering

 8 02:01:49   whether, in your view as an independent expert, what

 9 02:01:53   would be -- without looking at the documents, if you

10 02:01:57   were to be asked what would be the scope of works, what

11 02:02:00   would be the basis for you to assess the scope of works?

12 02:02:08.  Well, the basis of the project to be delivered is that

13 02:02:11   that's shown on the design drawings.  So in this case,

14 02:02:15   if we're looking at the tender, it would be the tender

15 02:02:18   drawings.

16 02:02:20       So it would be the measurement of the materials off

17 02:02:22   of those drawings that would form the basis of, in my

18 02:02:28   view, the tender programme and the plan to deliver that

19 02:02:34   design.

20 02:02:35.  It will be consistent with the general description given

21 02:02:38   here?  The works include earthworks for widening

22 02:02:46   improvements, realignment, geometry and side ditches?

23 02:02:53.  Sorry, could you repeat --

24 02:02:54.  I'm just wondering whether the works as defined here

25 02:02:58   would be a fair description of the type of works that


                                     112






 1 02:03:02   the contractor was due to deliver.  So improvements to

 2 02:03:12   alignment, construction of shoulders, base course,

 3 02:03:17   wearing course, these would be the works to be delivered

 4 02:03:21   by the contractor for this project?

 5 02:03:31.  Yes, I mean that's what I would understand.

 6 02:03:35.  Then you were shown a document slightly above, if you

 7 02:03:38   want to scroll up, it's a form, again, 4.6.3, entitled

 8 02:03:43   "Work Plan and Programme."

 9 02:03:51       Can you see it, 4.6.3, "Work Plan and Programme"?

10 02:03:56.  I see that, yes.

11 02:04:06.  It was put to you to read and consider the

12 02:04:08   section 4.6.3.2 and I'm just going to read it:

13 02:04:14       "Give a brief outline of your programme for

14 02:04:16   completing the works in accordance with the required

15 02:04:16   method of construction and stated time of completion."

16 02:04:21       You've been asked to consider the time for

17 02:04:22   completion was 30 months, and then there's a reference

18 02:04:26   here to sections of the method, attachment of statement,

19 02:04:31   which according to this is a response to the questions

20 02:04:33   outlined in the programme for completing the works

21 02:04:35   within a stated time of completion.

22 02:04:37       So we get 1.3 works programme, general remarks,

23 02:04:41   roadworks production rates.  Can you see that?

24 02:04:45.  I see that, yes.

25 02:04:47.  And then you measure those, so the following paragraph:


                                     113






 1 02:04:52       "Attach a critical milestone bar chart ...

 2 02:04:57   representing the construction programme and detailing

 3 02:04:59   relevant activities, dates, allocation of labour ..."

 4 02:05:02       And then you can see again a reference here to the

 5 02:05:04   bar chart programme of works and to section 14, road

 6 02:05:10   production rates of the attached method statement?

 7 02:05:12.  I see that, yes.

 8 02:05:13.  So in your experience as an expert, you have been asked

 9 02:05:16   by the president how would you go about defining

10 02:05:23   production rates based on the documents that are given

11 02:05:26   to you, and we come back to the specific scenarios or

12 02:05:31   options given to you --

13 02:05:33HE PRESIDENT:  No, that wasn't my question.

14 02:05:38R GILLION:  Oh.  Sorry.

15 02:05:39HE PRESIDENT:  My question was, looking at the wording in

16 02:05:41   the document and asking about production rates, as

17 02:05:42   an independent expert one would infer --

18 02:05:46R GILLION:  From that paragraph, obviously --

19 02:05:47HE PRESIDENT:  No, that's different than defining

20 02:05:49   production rates.  Inference is different than

21 02:05:49   definition.

22 02:05:50R GILLION:  Oh, I see, apologies.  So your question,

23 02:05:53   Mr President was?

24 02:05:54HE PRESIDENT:  Looking at the particular words on the

25 02:05:55   particular document, if the independent expert was asked


                                     114






 1 02:05:58   to apply those words, what production rates would he

 2 02:06:01   infer.

 3 02:06:03R GILLION:  Okay.

 4 02:06:04       So looking at this, how would you infer production

 5 02:06:08   rates as an independent expert from the documents

 6 02:06:13   referred to here?

 7 02:06:15.  Well, from this document I would infer the production

 8 02:06:19   rates as they're set out in the method statement,

 9 02:06:26   because there are no production rates set out in the

10 02:06:29   tender programme.

11 02:06:30.  So let's look at -- and so just to be clear, what

12 02:06:34   production rates are you referring to?

13 02:06:42.  In the tender method statement there are production

14 02:06:44   rates for different roadwork activities that are stated.

15 02:06:51.  Maybe we can look at that, section 14 of the method

16 02:06:54   statement.

17 02:06:57.  I can't remember the section number.

18 02:06:59.  It was actually the section put to you, so maybe we can

19 02:07:04   look at it, so section 14 of the tender method

20 02:07:07   statement.

21 02:07:07       The respondent's counsel asked you to consider the

22 02:07:11   introduction of that document.  Do you remember the

23 02:07:15   second paragraph in particular?

24 02:07:22.  Yes.

25 02:07:22.  You were only asked to comment about that specific


                                     115






 1 02:07:26   paragraph.

 2 02:07:26.  Yes.

 3 02:07:27.  Is there anything else that may be relevant to your

 4 02:07:29   answer in terms of how would you work out the production

 5 02:07:31   rates from that section?

 6 02:07:35.  Well, later on in the method statement there are stated

 7 02:07:38   production rates.  So I would naturally go to those

 8 02:07:43   first.

 9 02:07:45       But just in terms of interpreting -- I was asked

10 02:07:47   what would you infer from this sentence.  I mean, it's

11 02:07:52   a confusing sentence to me, and I think that there are

12 02:07:56   different inferences that could be drawn from that,

13 02:07:59   which is why I was struggling to answer the question put

14 02:08:02   by the chairman earlier.

15 02:08:08.  We saw your answer in relation to the scope of work

16 02:08:12   which was at section 1.2 of that same document.  Your

17 02:08:15   answer was the scope of work as shown in the drawings.

18 02:08:18   My question: would you infer the scope of work from the

19 02:08:22   BOQ?

20 02:08:29.  Well, I would infer the scope of work from the drawings,

21 02:08:31   not from the BOQ, but I -- I wouldn't rely on this

22 02:08:36   particular paragraph as an entity, if you like, to make

23 02:08:41   my full inferences on what is included in the tender

24 02:08:45   bid.

25 02:08:47.  It was suggested to you that you could possibly


                                     116






 1 02:08:53   derive -- infer the production rate from a combination

 2 02:08:57   of the BOQ and the programme of works, but let's look at

 3 02:09:03   the actual sentence:

 4 02:09:05       "In case of discrepancies between this information

 5 02:09:09   [stated in that section] and the production rates

 6 02:09:12   inferred from the attached BoQ, Table D) ... or the

 7 02:09:17   Programme of Works, these last three documents will

 8 02:09:20   prevail."

 9 02:09:20       Is there any indication of a combination?  It's all

10 02:09:24   here, but can we infer production rate solely from BOQ?

11 02:09:32       Can you --

12 02:09:33.  No.

13 02:09:34.  Can you derive production rates solely from the

14 02:09:38   programme of works?

15 02:09:49.  Not from the tender programme of works, no.

16 02:10:00.  It was suggested --

17 02:10:00.  The only way you can do it from the tender programme of

18 02:10:02   works is if you already have a basis for the quantity of

19 02:10:06   material that you're planning to perform.

20 02:10:15.  And where would you look for that basis?

21 02:10:18.  Well, I would look for the drawings.

22 02:10:20.  Thank you.  And again in your cross-examination it was

23 02:10:24   put to you that you could derive the -- or infer the

24 02:10:31   production rate, you can calculate the production rate

25 02:10:34   from the BOQ by reference to the period of


                                     117






 1 02:10:37   implementation of tasks.

 2 02:10:38       If you were to apply -- assuming that is the right

 3 02:10:45   approach, assuming you applied that approach, what would

 4 02:10:49   be roughly the production rate for rock fill in this

 5 02:10:52   particular project?

 6 02:10:59.  From the BOQ item and the tender programme?  I know the

 7 02:11:05   tender programme includes an activity of a duration for

 8 02:11:08   rock fill.  I can't remember the duration of it, but

 9 02:11:11   whatever that is, you would divide it into 7,000 metres

10 02:11:17   cubed in the BOQ.

11 02:11:19.  Maybe we can actually show the tender work programme.

12 02:11:28   And you can guide us as to where we find rock fill here.

13 02:11:31.  Row 34 shows 150 days.  So in terms of inferring, purely

14 02:11:36   from those two documents, you would take the 7,000 in

15 02:11:41   the BOQ, divide it by 150, and that would give you

16 02:11:44   a rate per day.

17 02:11:45.  I think we've done a calculation for you, I think it's

18 02:11:48   around 47 cubic metre per day, if I'm not mistaken.

19 02:11:53   Yes.

20 02:11:53       If you had to multiply the 47 cubic metres per

21 02:12:01   day -- and that's asking a lot from you, we'll help you

22 02:12:05   on that -- times the quantity of rock fill executed on

23 02:12:10   this project, let's say for the sake of argument it's

24 02:12:14   100,000 cubic metre -- I think it's more, but -- so what

25 02:12:18   would be the duration of this activity?


                                     118






 1 02:12:22.  Well, 100,000 times 47, I think you said, metres cubed

 2 02:12:30   a day would give you the working day period.  So, what's

 3 02:12:40   that, 473?

 4 02:12:42.  That's 2,127 days, which is in ... 71 months.

 5 02:12:58.  Right.

 6 02:12:59.  Roughly how many years?  Is it like 12?  Six years?

 7 02:13:05.  Six years, yes.

 8 02:13:19.  Would it be fair to say then when you calculate

 9 02:13:21   a production rate you look at a realistic figure, when

10 02:13:24   you actually assess -- if you were as an expert given

11 02:13:28   documents to assess what would be the production rate to

12 02:13:31   achieve the works, the delivery of the works within the

13 02:13:33   time for completion, you would select the realistic

14 02:13:35   production rate, correct?

15 02:13:37.  Yes, of course.  If you have 30 months to deliver

16 02:13:39   a project, then -- and you know what you have to perform

17 02:13:43   over that period, then you would work out what equipment

18 02:13:49   you need in order to do it within that period of time.

19 02:13:53       So obviously if you have an obligation to complete

20 02:13:56   a project in 30 months, you wouldn't plan to do

21 02:14:00   something which is going to take six years.

22 02:14:06R GILLION:  I have no further questions, sir.  Thank you.

23 02:14:10                Questions by THE TRIBUNAL

24 02:14:12HE PRESIDENT:  I have one or two questions.

25 02:14:18       The tribunal has not reached a view on any of this,


                                     119






 1 02:14:21   but let's talk about the rock fill first and then the

 2 02:14:25   lines of the road.

 3 02:14:30       One criticism that the tribunal thinks the claimant

 4 02:14:32   is making is that the precise locations for rock fill

 5 02:14:39   were only identified by someone later than they should

 6 02:14:43   have been.  You understand what I mean by that?

 7 02:14:47.  Yes.

 8 02:14:48HE PRESIDENT:  Does your analysis help the tribunal to work

 9 02:14:51   out what delay has been caused, if the precise locations

10 02:14:57   for the rock fill were located later than they should

11 02:15:00   have been?

12 02:15:02.  Yes.

13 02:15:03HE PRESIDENT:  Right.  Explain to us how.  What do I look

14 02:15:06   at in your analysis to help us with that?

15 02:15:08.  Okay, so as has been explained already, I believe, in

16 02:15:14   the hearing, the rock fill -- first of all, you have to

17 02:15:20   do some excavation, which creates a hole, which is then

18 02:15:24   filled with rock fill, and that has to be done before

19 02:15:26   the G7 gets placed over the top.

20 02:15:30HE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

21 02:15:30.  So because of the haphazard way in which the rock fill

22 02:15:33   was instructed, rock fill was put in and that affected

23 02:15:37   the productivity of the G7.

24 02:15:40       So rather than it being the case that rock fill

25 02:15:42   could be done in advance before the G7 train caught up


                                     120






 1 02:15:47   with the works, it was done in conjunction with the G7

 2 02:15:50   fill.  So on my analysis I've looked at what the delay

 3 02:15:55   was to the G7 fill, which was contributed to by the rock

 4 02:16:01   fill that was placed in certain periods, because that in

 5 02:16:05   those locations determined the pace at which the G7 fill

 6 02:16:09   was installed.

 7 02:16:13HE PRESIDENT:  So if we look at -- just to understand this,

 8 02:16:15   let's go back to your presentation.  By reference to one

 9 02:16:26   of the slides in that presentation, just explain to us,

10 02:16:32   at a higher level, if we take the view that, say, the

11 02:16:37   rock fill should have been identified at the point the

12 02:16:41   works started --

13 02:16:45.  Yes.

14 02:16:45HE PRESIDENT:  -- how do we go about assessing the days of

15 02:16:48   delay that were incurred as a result of that not

16 02:16:50   happening, bearing in mind that the same rock fill would

17 02:16:54   have to go in --

18 02:16:55.  Yes.

19 02:16:56HE PRESIDENT:  -- but there's been a delay, on this

20 02:16:59   hypothesis, of when it was identified where it had to go

21 02:17:02   in.

22 02:17:03.  Yes, okay.  Perhaps if you scroll down to the first

23 02:17:10   chart, or any one.  That one will do.

24 02:17:16HE PRESIDENT:  Let's just identify for the purposes of the

25 02:17:18   transcript the particular slide that you're looking at.


                                     121






 1 02:17:20   What's the number of the slide?

 2 02:17:23.  2.

 3 02:17:24HE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you.

 4 02:17:25.  So the G7 is shown by the blue bars.

 5 02:17:29HE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

 6 02:17:29.  That run all the way through to --

 7 02:17:37R GILLION:  Actually, it's slide 4.

 8 02:17:37HE PRESIDENT:  4.

 9 02:17:38.  All the way through from section 1 to section 7.

10 02:17:41HE PRESIDENT:  Yes, G7 shown by blue bars.

11 02:17:43.  Yes.  So if you've literally just started the project

12 02:17:48   and you're doing the G7 in section 1, and you already

13 02:17:51   know that there's 7,000 metres cubed of rock fill to be

14 02:17:54   placed somewhere else in the works, let's say in

15 02:17:57   section 7, then you've got time to undertake that work

16 02:18:02   before the G7 reaches it, so there wouldn't necessarily

17 02:18:05   be any impact on progress of the G7.

18 02:18:10       But the difficulty with not being able to do it in

19 02:18:12   advance, when it's done in conjunction with G7, because

20 02:18:17   you don't know the locations until you arrive at them,

21 02:18:21   in some parts, then it impacts on the progress of the

22 02:18:26   G7.

23 02:18:27       So I suppose, to answer your question, given how the

24 02:18:35   rock fill and G7 were done in conjunction, I think the

25 02:18:39   simplest calculation would be: if you found that


                                     122






 1 02:18:43   7,000 metres cubed of rock fill should have been

 2 02:18:46   accounted for, and if you found that the 170 metres

 3 02:18:50   cubed production rate is a fair rate for doing that

 4 02:18:55   work, then you divide 7,000 by 170, which would give you

 5 02:19:02   a number of days.  I think it works out about

 6 02:19:05   seven weeks because I looked at it before.

 7 02:19:09       So you would potentially say that you've added

 8 02:19:13   seven weeks, if you like, to the programme to undertake

 9 02:19:16   that rock fill if it was instructed whilst the G7 was

10 02:19:19   going on.

11 02:19:24HE PRESIDENT:  So I don't think I -- do you understand

12 02:19:26   that?

13 02:19:26S DOERRIES:  No.

14 02:19:27HE PRESIDENT:  I'm afraid I didn't follow a word of that.

15 02:19:29   I'm sure that's my fault.

16 02:19:31.  I'll try again.

17 02:19:32HE PRESIDENT:  Let me break it down.

18 02:19:35       Am I right that you take the view that the critical

19 02:19:38   path goes through the blue activities, which is the blue

20 02:19:43   G7 fill?

21 02:19:45.  Yes.

22 02:19:46HE PRESIDENT:  I was understanding you up to the point you

23 02:19:47   started doing the calculation.  I understand you to say

24 02:19:50   the effect of only knowing where the rock fill goes

25 02:19:53   later than the start of the works is that there are


                                     123






 1 02:19:57   periods of delay which the G7 fill are then subjected

 2 02:20:02   to?

 3 02:20:03.  Yes.

 4 02:20:03HE PRESIDENT:  Because you have to do rock fill before you

 5 02:20:05   can turn to do your G7.  Have I got it right so far?

 6 02:20:10.  Exactly, yes.

 7 02:20:11HE PRESIDENT:  If I look at the chart on the screen in

 8 02:20:13   front of us, can I identify the periods of delay to the

 9 02:20:16   blue G7 fill, which is caused by rock fill having to be

10 02:20:21   done first before the G7 fill goes in?

11 02:20:26.  No.  This is a representation of PoIT rev 0 and there's

12 02:20:30   no allowance for rock fill in here.

13 02:20:32HE PRESIDENT:  Fine.

14 02:20:33.  I was trying --

15 02:20:34HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Where in your reports can I get that

16 02:20:40   from then, the periods where the blue bars are delayed

17 02:20:47   and therefore critical delay on your analysis is caused

18 02:20:50   because rock fill is having to be done first?

19 02:20:54.  Yes, you need to look at windows 4 to 9 essentially.  So

20 02:21:03   most of the rock fill came in in phase two, so from

21 02:21:07   window 4 onwards I look at phase two.  So in every

22 02:21:11   window where rock fill was placed, I do an assessment of

23 02:21:13   how much time was lost in G7 by undertaking the rock

24 02:21:17   fill work and I account for that in my quantification of

25 02:21:21   delay to G7.


                                     124






 1 02:21:23HE PRESIDENT:  So I'll need to read this again more

 2 02:21:25   carefully then, but what I thought I had picked up was

 3 02:21:28   that you weren't saying rock fill had to be done and

 4 02:21:32   that there was an end-to-start relationship between rock

 5 02:21:36   fill and G7.  I thought your report was talking about

 6 02:21:40   two things happening concurrently, rock fill and G7 at

 7 02:21:43   the same time?

 8 02:21:45.  Yes, I mean --

 9 02:21:46HE PRESIDENT:  Did I misunderstand that?

10 02:21:47.  No, no, that's exactly right, but in reality, of course,

11 02:21:50   you can't do the two activities exactly at the same time

12 02:21:53   in the same location.

13 02:21:56HE PRESIDENT:  No.

14 02:21:56.  But the records don't -- are not sufficiently detailed

15 02:21:59   to say on this day that there was G7 -- or rock fill and

16 02:22:02   then the next day there was G7.  There's just a general

17 02:22:07   G7 and rock fill being placed over the same overall

18 02:22:11   period at the same time.  The reality of course is that

19 02:22:16   one would follow the other.  But the overall period,

20 02:22:19   both were done together in several of those windows that

21 02:22:24   deal with phase two, so it's sections 4 to section 7.

22 02:22:38HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  So that's slightly different from

23 02:22:40   what I just understood you to say, so let me look at

24 02:22:43   that.

25 02:22:43       If I look at a particular window that's dealing with


                                     125






 1 02:22:47   chainages across the site, and it's a relatively wide

 2 02:22:50   site, there's some 67-odd kilometres of it, it must be

 3 02:22:55   theoretically possible if it's a long enough chainage to

 4 02:23:00   be putting in rock fill sufficiently ahead of the other

 5 02:23:05   fill catching up with it?

 6 02:23:07.  Well, yes, if you know in advance where it's going, and

 7 02:23:11   I understand --

 8 02:23:12HE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but even if you don't.  Let's say I get

 9 02:23:15   to a -- I'll need to look at this more carefully, but

10 02:23:23   let's say I get to a 2-kilometre stretch of the site and

11 02:23:26   as I start that 2-kilometre stretch, I'm told: by the

12 02:23:31   way, rock fill is going into bits of this 2 kilometres.

13 02:23:34       And I say to myself: oh my goodness, I didn't know

14 02:23:37   that until now and I'm just about to start this section.

15 02:23:41       In theory, it might be possible to put the rock fill

16 02:23:48   in and the G7 fill in any way where the G7's not held

17 02:23:52   up.  It must be theoretically a possibility, depending

18 02:23:56   on exactly where the rock fill has to go in?

19 02:23:59.  Yes, if you know in advance that it's 2 kilometres up

20 02:24:05   the road before you reach it with the G7.

21 02:24:07HE PRESIDENT:  Let's say you have chainages for

22 02:24:09   2 kilometres, 4,000 to 6,000, and I'm starting chainages

23 02:24:14   4,000 to 6,000 and I know the rock fill has to go in in

24 02:24:18   chainage 4,800 to 4,900, and chainage 5,400 to

25 02:24:24   chainage 5,500.


                                     126






 1 02:24:30       I may or may not, depending on how I'm going to do

 2 02:24:33   the works, be able to insert that rock fill whilst I'm

 3 02:24:35   putting in the fill in the other chainages, such that it

 4 02:24:36   doesn't hold up the blue fill.

 5 02:24:40       Have you done an analysis where you have identified

 6 02:24:44   that in fact for this job that was impossible?  That in

 7 02:24:48   fact, the fact that rock fill had to go into these

 8 02:24:51   chainages at that time means that people couldn't work

 9 02:24:56   around that and couldn't put the blue bar fill in?  If

10 02:25:05   I go and look at your reports, can I find you going:

11 02:25:08   I've looked at this --

12 02:25:09.  Yes.

13 02:25:09HE PRESIDENT:  -- I can tell that rock fill going in there

14 02:25:11   did in fact mean that fill couldn't go into those

15 02:25:16   particular areas at this period of time and it therefore

16 02:25:20   held up that activity?

17 02:25:22.  Yes, only to the point of view of -- in a particular

18 02:25:25   month there's G7 and rock fill being undertaken in that

19 02:25:28   month in a certain section.  So there isn't that

20 02:25:33   granular level of detail to say: over the next

21 02:25:39   800 metres of length or the next 1 kilometre of length

22 02:25:44   was the rock fill holding up the G7 in that location.

23 02:25:51HE PRESIDENT:  So does your analysis proceed on

24 02:25:53   an assumption -- and no doubt you would say

25 02:25:56   a commonsense assumption -- that if rock fill and G7


                                     127






 1 02:26:00   fill are happening in roughly the same location at

 2 02:26:05   roughly the same time, that must have delayed the G7

 3 02:26:09   fill?

 4 02:26:09.  Yes, because from the records that I can see, which have

 5 02:26:11   got some limitations, as I mentioned, they show rock

 6 02:26:15   fill and G7 occurring at the same time in a section.

 7 02:26:19HE PRESIDENT:  But how big is the section?  Is it

 8 02:26:22   a 10-metre certification or is it a 2-kilometre section?

 9 02:26:27.  All the sections are of slightly different lengths so it

10 02:26:30   could be any one of those.  But if it's the case that

11 02:26:34   it's happening at the same time, then either the

12 02:26:37   equipment that's doing G7 either has to stop and

13 02:26:41   demobilise and go somewhere else to carry on, so there's

14 02:26:46   some disruption there, like leapfrog the area where the

15 02:26:48   rock fill is going in, or it just stops --

16 02:26:52HE PRESIDENT:  So I understand disruption.  Right.  We can

17 02:26:54   all understand if you have two activities happening in

18 02:26:57   an area, depending on how big the area is, it may or may

19 02:27:02   not cause disruption, and the smaller the area, the more

20 02:27:05   likely there is disruption.  I'm with you.

21 02:27:07.  Yes.

22 02:27:08HE PRESIDENT:  But delay is different than disruption.  If

23 02:27:11   two activities are happening in an area and there is

24 02:27:14   leapfrogging going on, there may not be any delay,

25 02:27:17   right?  That happens all the time.


                                     128






 1 02:27:21.  Well, there will be some delay.  Obviously you have to

 2 02:27:24   move equipment.

 3 02:27:28HE PRESIDENT:  Well, okay.  But what assumption have you

 4 02:27:32   made about the delay which is being caused?  Have you

 5 02:27:36   taken the view that for every day in which both

 6 02:27:39   activities are going on, that's a day's delay?

 7 02:27:41.  Yes.

 8 02:27:43HE PRESIDENT:  Why?

 9 02:27:44.  Both activities are going on on the same day within

10 02:27:48   a section.

11 02:27:49HE PRESIDENT:  How big's a section?  2 metres or

12 02:27:55   a kilometre?

13 02:27:58.  Oh no -- well, over a kilometre.  I mean, the sections

14 02:28:00   are all different, but I think section 7 is maybe

15 02:28:04   9 kilometres long, others are shorter.

16 02:28:08HE PRESIDENT:  So just -- and you may well be right about

17 02:28:10   this, I haven't reached a view and my fellow arbitrators

18 02:28:14   haven't.  But just explain to me why the assumption one

19 02:28:16   should make, if both activities are going on on

20 02:28:21   a section which is a kilometre or more long, why should

21 02:28:24   one assume it's a day's delay to the blue activity for

22 02:28:29   every day in which the rock fill activity is also going

23 02:28:34   on?

24 02:28:37.  Well, if you look at the productivity of G7 before it

25 02:28:40   gets interrupted by rock fill, it's much higher.  And


                                     129






 1 02:28:43   then as soon as the rock fill instructions start coming

 2 02:28:46   in, you see a drop in productivity of G7.

 3 02:28:50       So I admit it's an assumption, but my assumption is

 4 02:28:54   that the rock fill has impacted upon the G7 fill in that

 5 02:29:00   period.

 6 02:29:01       And you can see it on phase two.

 7 02:29:05HE PRESIDENT:  So let me understand that then.  The

 8 02:29:06   productivity is the a per-day productivity?

 9 02:29:10.  The records only -- I only have quantities per month.

10 02:29:15HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

11 02:29:16.  So I can divide it and get

12 02:29:18   an average -- (overspeaking) --

13 02:29:19HE PRESIDENT:  An average per day per month?

14 02:29:20.  -- in a month.  And it might be more than that on one

15 02:29:22   day, it might be less than that on another day, but it's

16 02:29:25   just an average productivity of what was achieved in

17 02:29:27   a month.

18 02:29:29HE PRESIDENT:  And it's not a memory test so I'm not asking

19 02:29:31   for precise numbers, but what is the nature of the drop

20 02:29:34   of productivity you noticed when the rock fill is being

21 02:29:39   done in the same section?  Is it a 20% drop?  Is it

22 02:29:43   a 50% drop?

23 02:29:44.  Well, unfortunately it's not necessarily consistent.

24 02:29:48   I mean I do have a graph in my second report.  (Pause)

25 02:31:00       Apologies.


                                     130






 1 02:31:01HE PRESIDENT:  Don't worry.

 2 02:31:01.  My second report, if you go to paragraph 4.12.40 --

 3 02:31:08HE PRESIDENT:  Just for the purposes of the transcript,

 4 02:31:09   this is document, as I understand it, CXS-3, which is

 5 02:31:15   the supplemental expert report dated 15 November 2024;

 6 02:31:18   is that right?

 7 02:31:21.  Yes.

 8 02:31:22HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Which page within it?

 9 02:31:25.  It's paragraph 4.12.40 on page 80, figure 25.

10 02:31:37HE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

11 02:31:40.  Just as a health warning, there is an error on this

12 02:31:44   graph.  In February 2021, the spike at the extreme

13 02:31:47   left-hand side of the chart.  So I corrected the figures

14 02:31:51   which are appended in the updated quantities, G7 actual

15 02:32:00   quantities chart which was appended to the first joint

16 02:32:02   statement and then corrected in my fourth report, but it

17 02:32:06   doesn't make any difference to this.

18 02:32:11       But if you -- you need to go down --

19 02:32:15HE PRESIDENT:  This is a daily --

20 02:32:16.  -- a couple of pages --

21 02:32:17HE PRESIDENT:  Let me understand it then.  I get your point

22 02:32:19   that there may be an aberration of a spike for February.

23 02:32:23   Let's ignore that, I'm not concerned about that.

24 02:32:28.  12.40.

25 02:32:28HE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me?


                                     131






 1 02:32:28.  Sorry, we're on the wrong chart.

 2 02:32:31HE PRESIDENT:  I have it at page 80, figure 25?

 3 02:32:37S DOERRIES:  The screen is on the wrong chart.

 4 02:32:40HE PRESIDENT:  Ah, okay.

 5 02:32:40.  Yes, so --

 6 02:32:40HE PRESIDENT:  So I understand the chart, now we can see it

 7 02:32:43   on the screen, there is a long horizontal box with red

 8 02:32:47   dashes and yellow infill.  Is that the period in which

 9 02:32:53   the rock fill is being done at the same time?

10 02:32:58.  Yes.  And that covers most of the -- well, all of the

11 02:33:06   phase two sections.

12 02:33:08HE PRESIDENT:  Right.  And your point is that you ascribe

13 02:33:17   the variability, if I can put it that way, of

14 02:33:23   productivity that's happening over that period to the

15 02:33:26   fact that rock fill is happening at the same time?

16 02:33:30.  Yes.

17 02:33:33HE PRESIDENT:  Right.

18 02:33:33.  There's actually a different version of this chart,

19 02:33:35   which went in the claimant's opening statement, which

20 02:33:40   actually has the volume of rock fill placed in that

21 02:33:45   period.

22 02:33:46HE PRESIDENT:  I'll look at that if I have to, but at the

23 02:33:49   minute I'm keen to understand your evidence rather than

24 02:33:51   in submissions.

25 02:33:52.  Yes.


                                     132






 1 02:33:58HE PRESIDENT:  I don't want this to sound like

 2 02:34:00   cross-examination.  I'm trying to understand it.

 3 02:34:02.  Yes.

 4 02:34:02HE PRESIDENT:  We're not talking about a uniform drop-off

 5 02:34:05   of productivity here, are we?  We're talking about

 6 02:34:08   increased variability?

 7 02:34:15.  Well, generally speaking, when I look at the chart I can

 8 02:34:19   see more drop in performance, if you like, in G7 fill in

 9 02:34:24   the yellow box than towards the left-hand side of the

10 02:34:28   yellow box.

11 02:34:30HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

12 02:34:31.  But the productivity varies month on month.

13 02:34:34HE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I get that.  Just in your own words,

14 02:34:40   tell us how you derive from the drop-off or the

15 02:34:45   variability -- because obviously there's some spikes.

16 02:34:46       The variability/drop-off in productivity over that

17 02:34:53   period, how do you derive days of delay from that?

18 02:34:59.  Well, I look at the days of delay to the G7 fill.  The

19 02:35:07   delay to the G7 fill, on my analysis, is caused by two

20 02:35:16   things: one is the increased quantities in the G7 fill

21 02:35:20   in a particular period, and two, the impact of rock fill

22 02:35:24   on the performance of that work over a particular period

23 02:35:27   of time.

24 02:35:30HE PRESIDENT:  So do you do it this way: there's

25 02:35:31   a horizontal line which is in grey which is described as


                                     133






 1 02:35:36   "Strabag PoIT planned".  For any blue bars where they

 2 02:35:43   drop below that line, do you take that diminution in

 3 02:35:47   productivity and then say: if I take that quantity of

 4 02:35:56   productivity and I divide it by the productivity rates

 5 02:35:59   shown in PoIT, that gives me a day of delay?  Sorry,

 6 02:36:03   that gives me a number of days of delay?

 7 02:36:10.  No.  I look at when the G7 was actually performed, when

 8 02:36:13   it was completed in a particular section, and I just

 9 02:36:16   compare that to a corresponding plan date, and then

10 02:36:20   I measure the two and the difference will be the delay

11 02:36:23   in G7 fill over that period.  And then I look at the --

12 02:36:27HE PRESIDENT:  You literally just take when it was actually

13 02:36:30   finished, you look at the plan and you just ascribe

14 02:36:34   every day of delay to that, to the fact that rock fill

15 02:36:37   was introduced?

16 02:36:39.  No.  So part of it is explained by the increased

17 02:36:42   quantities of G7, so over that period, through the

18 02:36:47   line and levels design changes, more work in the

19 02:36:50   sections was undertaken, so that's part of it.  But when

20 02:36:55   the productivity drops off through this period on the

21 02:37:02   right-hand side of the chart, on my analysis I say that

22 02:37:04   was caused by the introduction over those periods of the

23 02:37:07   rock fill that was placed in conjunction with the G7,

24 02:37:10   which caused it to finish later than it would otherwise

25 02:37:14   have done.


                                     134






 1 02:37:22HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  And you work on the premise that had

 2 02:37:33   the contractor known about this earlier, he would have

 3 02:37:37   jumped ahead to do the rock fill, so whenever the G7 got

 4 02:37:40   there, the rock fill would already have been done?

 5 02:37:43.  Well, that would be the way to plan it, to avoid the

 6 02:37:50   rock fill having any impact.

 7 02:37:52HE PRESIDENT:  Whenever the rock fill instructions were

 8 02:37:54   given eventually, was that what was done?

 9 02:37:59.  Was it what, sorry?

10 02:38:01HE PRESIDENT:  Was that what was done, that whenever the

11 02:38:03   rock fill instructions were given later than the start

12 02:38:06   of the works, to use a neutral term, did in fact Strabag

13 02:38:09   then jump ahead and do that rock fill?  In other words,

14 02:38:17   as soon as they knew about it, did they in fact then

15 02:38:19   plan the works in that way?

16 02:38:22.  I don't know the answer to that.

17 02:38:27HE PRESIDENT:  But your assumption is that that is how they

18 02:38:29   would have planned the works, had they been told

19 02:38:31   earlier?

20 02:38:32.  Yes, if they knew --

21 02:38:33HE PRESIDENT:  But you haven't checked whether or not that

22 02:38:35   is in fact how they did plan the works once they were

23 02:38:38   told?

24 02:38:44.  Well, I don't think all of the rock fill was given in

25 02:38:46   instructions like that in advance, but I don't know if


                                     135






 1 02:38:50   the instruction --

 2 02:38:52HE PRESIDENT:  I think -- sorry to interrupt you.  What

 3 02:38:56   I think I have got from the evidence so far, and this

 4 02:39:01   may be disputed, but I have got the impression that rock

 5 02:39:05   fill was instructed in waves.  So we saw the graph

 6 02:39:11   earlier in the cross-examination of one of the witnesses

 7 02:39:13   where some rock fill is instructed and then some later

 8 02:39:15   and some later and some later.

 9 02:39:17       Whenever additional rock fill was instructed -- and

10 02:39:21   I think the first one was February 2021 -- did in fact

11 02:39:25   Strabag then plan its works in the way that you have

12 02:39:28   said they would have, had they been told at the start?

13 02:39:35   Or do you not know?

14 02:39:37.  I don't know.

15 02:39:37HE PRESIDENT:  Why haven't you checked that?  Because that

16 02:39:42   seems like it's something that might be relevant to your

17 02:39:47   conclusions that that is how they would have planned the

18 02:39:50   works, had they been told earlier.  Isn't it?

19 02:40:00.  Possibly.  I don't know if they did it in advance.

20 02:40:03   I mean, my understanding was it was pretty much done at

21 02:40:06   the same time, because if you look at the records, the

22 02:40:09   works were undertaken, G7 and rock fill, in the month,

23 02:40:14   in a section, at the same time.  Whether that could have

24 02:40:20   been done in advance, I'm not sure.

25 02:40:24HE PRESIDENT:  But your assumption is it would have been


                                     136






 1 02:40:26   done in advance, had they been told earlier?

 2 02:40:30.  Yes.

 3 02:40:30HE PRESIDENT:  Right.

 4 02:40:31       Finally, same question, which you've partially

 5 02:40:35   answered in relation to the change in line and so on.

 6 02:40:41   Again I understand the concept that this was a late

 7 02:40:44   instruction and therefore we want to treat it as

 8 02:40:50   a variation.  I understand that.  The tribunal might be

 9 02:40:53   interested again in whether there's any case to be made

10 02:40:56   of, well, had you done that earlier in what's

11 02:41:00   a remeasurable contract, that would have avoided delays;

12 02:41:03   you changed that design later than you should have done.

13 02:41:07       Do you understand the point?

14 02:41:08.  Yes, so if the revised design was available on day 1 --

15 02:41:12HE PRESIDENT:  For example, yes.  There may be a debate

16 02:41:14   between the parties as to whether that's reasonable, but

17 02:41:16   let's assume that a case can be made that the design

18 02:41:20   should have been available on day 1.  Where in your

19 02:41:32   analysis can we identify the consequences of the design

20 02:41:37   being available on day 250 as opposed to day 1?

21 02:41:48.  I don't think you'll find that answer in my analysis.

22 02:41:52   I haven't addressed the question of what the impact

23 02:41:55   would have been had the revised design been issued

24 02:42:01   earlier than it in fact was.

25 02:42:03HE PRESIDENT:  And it may be you don't have to, it may be


                                     137






 1 02:42:05   the claimant's case doesn't turn on that, but we're just

 2 02:42:08   interested in whether, if we reach the view the design

 3 02:42:11   should have been issued earlier rather than later, there

 4 02:42:14   is an analysis that we can take from your report, but

 5 02:42:16   I think the answer is there isn't.

 6 02:42:19.  No.

 7 02:42:20HE PRESIDENT:  All right, fine.  Again, no criticism, just

 8 02:42:22   interested.

 9 02:42:29       Okay.  Is there any further questions from the

10 02:42:33   respondent arising directly from the questions I have

11 02:42:36   asked?

12 02:42:38R ATWINE:  Yes.

13 02:42:39HE PRESIDENT:  Can you ask those questions?

14                   Further cross-examination by MR ATWINE

15 02:42:43R ATWINE:  Okay, just one question.

16 02:42:45       Mr Cookson, just so you confirm, phase two, the

17 02:42:49   phase two under discussion in your paragraph 4.12.40 was

18 02:42:55   about 35 kilometres; am I correct?

19 02:42:59.  Yes.

20 02:43:02.  And the total sections affected by rock fill was about

21 02:43:07   8.99 kilometres?

22 02:43:11.  I heard that dimension referenced earlier, but it's not

23 02:43:16   a calculation I've done so I don't know.

24 02:43:19.  Okay.  So if we are to go with that figure, that would

25 02:43:24   mean the contractor had about 26.01 kilometres without


                                     138






 1 02:43:32   rock fill where they could actually proceed with G7?

 2 02:43:36.  Assuming your dimension is correct, then yes, I wouldn't

 3 02:43:41   disagree with that.  But I don't -- my understanding is

 4 02:43:44   that the rock fill was in lots of different locations.

 5 02:43:46   It wasn't just one area which could have been dealt with

 6 02:43:50   very quickly and released everything else; it was all

 7 02:43:55   over the place.

 8 02:43:58R ATWINE:  Okay.

 9 02:43:59HE PRESIDENT:  You've asked your questions?

10 02:44:00R ATWINE:  Yes.

11 02:44:01HE PRESIDENT:  Mr Gillion, are there any questions arising

12 02:44:04   directly from the questions I've asked?

13 02:44:07R GILLION:  Yes, just one.

14 02:44:09           Further re-examination by MR GILLION

15 02:44:11R GILLION:  Would there be any constraint on the use of

16 02:44:14   resources, talking about equipment now, to carry out

17 02:44:16   rock fill and G7 fill on this project?

18 02:44:19.  Yes, I mean the restraint on resources would depend on

19 02:44:24   obviously the volumes that you're talking about.  If

20 02:44:26   you're talking about the actual 125,000-odd metres

21 02:44:31   cubed, then obviously that wouldn't have been planned

22 02:44:34   for originally, so -- and it obviously required

23 02:44:38   resources to undertake.

24 02:44:43HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much indeed for your

25 02:44:47   evidence and your patience with our questions.


                                     139






 1 02:44:49   I appreciate it.  You're now released, although

 2 02:44:53   I anticipate you may want to hear what your fellow

 3 02:44:56   expert says.  Thank you.

 4 02:44:58.  Thank you.

 5 02:45:00                (The witness was released)

 6 02:45:01HE PRESIDENT:  I suggest we push straight on to hear

 7 02:45:03   from -- I see Mr Singhal is in the room.

 8 02:45:09                MR ROHIT SINGHAL (called)

 9 02:45:53R GILLION:  Mr President, just housekeeping or time

10 02:45:55   planning.

11 02:45:56HE PRESIDENT:  Sure.

12 02:45:57R GILLION:  We had not anticipated the further debate

13 02:46:01   about -- and re-examination.  So in terms of planning,

14 02:46:06   I think we still anticipate two and a half hours for the

15 02:46:08   cross-examination of Mr Singhal.  That would push it to

16 02:46:11   5.15.  Hopefully it is acceptable to the tribunal?

17 02:46:14HE PRESIDENT:  That's no problem, no problem for me.

18 02:46:15       Is that okay?  That's fine.

19 02:46:18R GILLION:  Okay, thank you.

20 02:46:22HE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, Mr Singhal.  How are you?

21 02:46:25.  Good afternoon.  Very fine, thank you, sir.

22 02:46:27HE PRESIDENT:  There should be a form of words on the piece

23 02:46:29   of paper in front of you.  Would you mind holding up

24 02:46:32   your right hand and reading out that form of words?

25 02:46:34.  I, Rohit Singhal, do solemnly, sincerely and truly


                                     140






 1 02:46:39   declare and affirm that the evidence I shall give is the

 2 02:46:41   truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

 3 02:46:43       Thank you.

 4 02:46:46HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  You have submitted a series of

 5 02:46:49   reports.  The parties have agreed that in this phase of

 6 02:46:52   giving your evidence, you will deal just with your delay

 7 02:46:56   reports, and then on Monday you'll deal with your

 8 02:46:58   quantum reports.

 9 02:46:58       So I anticipate you're about to be handed copies of

10 02:47:03   your delay reports alone, which they will ask you to

11 02:47:05   confirm the accuracy of.

12 02:47:07.  Yes, sir.

13 02:47:12            Examination-in-chief by MR ATWINE

14 02:47:34R ATWINE:  Good afternoon, Mr Singhal.

15 02:47:35.  Good afternoon.

16 02:47:36.  Before you are the reports which you have prepared in

17 02:47:38   this matter.  How many reports have you prepared in this

18 02:47:40   matter, Mr Singhal?

19 02:47:41.  There are three reports and two joint reports.

20 02:47:48.  Okay.  Do you confirm the contents of those reports is

21 02:47:51   yours?

22 02:47:51.  Yes, I confirm.

23 02:47:52.  Okay.  And the joint reports as well?

24 02:47:54.  Yes, I confirm.

25 02:47:57R ATWINE:  Okay.  Now I'm going to hand you over to counsel


                                     141






 1 02:47:59   for the claimant for cross-examination.

 2 02:48:02.  Yes.  I have a presentation to be done.

 3 02:48:07R ATWINE:  You can start with your presentation.

 4 02:48:10.  Thank you very much.

 5 02:48:11HE PRESIDENT:  Just before you do, you've confirmed the

 6 02:48:13   contents of the reports are yours, but can you just

 7 02:48:15   confirm for good order that the contents of those

 8 02:48:17   reports taken together represent your true and genuinely

 9 02:48:20   held independent expert views in relation to delay for

10 02:48:24   this matter?

11 02:48:25.  Yes, sir, I confirm.

12 02:48:26HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.

13 02:48:27.  Thank you.

14 02:48:32                Presentation by MR SINGHAL

15 02:48:43.  Good afternoon, members of the tribunal, this is my

16 02:48:45   presentation on delay.  Next slide.  Next slide.

17 02:48:50       This is just giving an introduction about my

18 02:48:53   experience and the reports which I have produced.

19 02:48:56       Next slide.

20 02:48:58       So this slide gives an idea about the agreements and

21 02:49:02   disagreement.  I think a good number of agreements have

22 02:49:06   been achieved between the experts.  Method of analysis,

23 02:49:10   the baseline schedule, which is the rev 0, the windows

24 02:49:14   are agreed.  Magnitude of critical delay, there are some

25 02:49:18   differences in some of the windows but they are minor in


                                     142






 1 02:49:21   nature.  Overall the magnitude is more or less agreed.

 2 02:49:25       The disagreement between the experts is between the

 3 02:49:28   use of rev 3 schedule, which I disagree, which

 4 02:49:30   Mr Cookson has used, but rev 3 schedule is not

 5 02:49:35   an approved schedule so I have not used in my analysis.

 6 02:49:38       And then the critical path, although there are

 7 02:49:41   disagreements, but as I will explain in my subsequent

 8 02:49:43   slide, the disagreement is going to probably go to the

 9 02:49:47   causes of delay.  And the reason why there is

10 02:49:50   a disagreement is that Mr Cookson has done his analysis

11 02:49:54   more global in nature, so his views are, wherever G7

12 02:49:59   works are ongoing, let's say if section 1, 2, 3, G7 are

13 02:50:05   ongoing, he will say the entire section 1, 2 and 3 are

14 02:50:09   critical.  If section 4, 5, 6, 7, simultaneously G7 is

15 02:50:13   going on; or if section 7 along with ATR is going on, he

16 02:50:15   will say section 7 and ATR together are critical.

17 02:50:19       So he does not get into the granularity of which

18 02:50:23   section is critical based on the delays which are taking

19 02:50:27   place, the critical delays which are taking place, and

20 02:50:27   hence there is some bit of disagreement.

21 02:50:29       Next slide.

22 02:50:32       So I think, sirs and ma'am, you have already heard

23 02:50:37   from Mr Cookson during his presentation about this

24 02:50:40   planned sequence of work.  One important point is that

25 02:50:46   the link between section 3 and section 4 is between cut


                                     143






 1 02:50:54   to spoil, and I will explain you.  Primarily the main

 2 02:50:59   difference between the experts is on two issues, which

 3 02:51:02   Mr Cookson also presented during his presentation: is

 4 02:51:07   when section 4 was to start and the leapfrogging of

 5 02:51:12   section 5.  So these are two major issues.

 6 02:51:16       And then subsequently you will see the difference

 7 02:51:19   emanates primarily because of the level of productivity

 8 02:51:22   which has been considered by the experts, and then in

 9 02:51:24   the last section, 9b and 10, the differences are coming

10 02:51:28   because of the kind of works which are taking place.

11 02:51:32       Next slide.

12 02:51:35       So the tribunal has already heard that there is

13 02:51:39   different type of productivities which are appearing in

14 02:51:44   this project.  There is a rev 0 productivity of G7 --

15 02:51:49   I'm talking about G7 because, you know, G7 has been used

16 02:51:52   as a representative of the kind of progress of the

17 02:51:56   various sections.

18 02:51:58       So you have the rev 0 productivity, which is coming

19 02:52:02   from the rev 0 programme, and that is derived based on

20 02:52:06   the tender drawing quantities of 514,911 cubic metre of

21 02:52:13   G7, which comes to 812 metre cubed per day.

22 02:52:17       Then you have a BOQ quantity which is 883,715 metre

23 02:52:23   cubed, and if this quantity is applied over rev 0

24 02:52:27   duration, which is around 771 days, roughly, this gives

25 02:52:30   a productivity of 1,473 metres cubed per day.  Then


                                     144






 1 02:52:35   of course there are other productivities which are

 2 02:52:37   emanating from the Table D of the BOQ and coming from

 3 02:52:41   the tender programmes, etc.

 4 02:52:44       One important point is that if 812.5 metres cubed

 5 02:52:51   per day of productivity is applied to the BOQ

 6 02:52:54   quantities, so the duration is of the baseline, the

 7 02:53:00   productivity is 812.5, the BOQ quantity of 8877 --

 8 02:53:05   883,715 is taken, then the contractual duration of

 9 02:53:11   30 months cannot be met.

10 02:53:15       So as an independent expert what I did is I am

11 02:53:19   providing the tribunal with two scenarios.

12 02:53:21       Number one scenario is: if the BOQ quantities

13 02:53:26   883,715 is used and the duration of the baseline is

14 02:53:30   used, then a productivity of 1,473 metres cubed per day

15 02:53:36   is there.  That is my scenario one.

16 02:53:38       Then in my last joint statement, I have provided

17 02:53:41   scenario two as well, where I am saying that in the

18 02:53:46   event tribunal thinks that the BOQ productivity of

19 02:53:50   812.5 metres cubed per day is to be used, then in that

20 02:53:55   case I have given an alternate scenario, primarily

21 02:53:58   changes the causes of delay and to some extent the

22 02:54:03   magnitude of delay.

23 02:54:05       Next slide.

24 02:54:09       Next slide.

25 02:54:15       So, sir, I'm going to give you an overview of the


                                     145






 1 02:54:17   comparison between the experts.  This is a slightly big

 2 02:54:22   slide.

 3 02:54:22       The experts are almost on a common viewpoint and

 4 02:54:26   there is no disagreement on my primary analysis for

 5 02:54:31   window 1, 2a, 2b and 3a.  Although in 3a there is some

 6 02:54:38   disagreement, but I believe that that is not of much

 7 02:54:44   relevance because the calculations of delay done by

 8 02:54:46   Mr Cookson also starts from window 3b.

 9 02:54:50       Now, window 3b, window 4, window 5a and window 5b,

10 02:54:57   remember, sir, the windows are agreed between the

11 02:54:59   experts.  So in these four windows, there is

12 02:55:02   disagreement.  The disagreement is not that much on

13 02:55:06   magnitude, but we can keep that aside.

14 02:55:09       The disagreement is emanating from two fundamental

15 02:55:11   issues which tribunal will have to decide.  One is

16 02:55:16   section 4, why was it delayed in the start?  And the

17 02:55:22   second issue is the leapfrogging of section 5 and moving

18 02:55:25   from section 5 to section 6, the leapfrogging one.

19 02:55:29       So in my view, these are two issues which have

20 02:55:32   caused delay in window 3b, 4, 5a and 5b, and that's the

21 02:55:38   reason you will see this in the coloured portion in the

22 02:55:41   slide and this is my primary analysis.

23 02:55:44       Can we slightly go down on this slide only.

24 02:55:47       And then when you see the other coloured section,

25 02:55:52   window 7, window 8, there is disagreement primarily


                                     146






 1 02:55:56   because I say -- and in windows 6, 7 and 8 I'm giving

 2 02:56:02   an extra critical delay or a critical delay because of

 3 02:56:07   the additional quantities which are coming from cut to

 4 02:56:11   spoil, rock fill, etc.

 5 02:56:14       The disagreement is on window 7, small portion, and

 6 02:56:19   window 8, because I say although there is a delay due to

 7 02:56:24   additional cut to spoil, but there is also a slow

 8 02:56:28   progress because here in the primary analysis, I have

 9 02:56:31   taken the 1,400-something metre cubed per day.

10 02:56:38       This disagreement on windows 7 and 8 will not be

11 02:56:40   there when I go to my secondary analysis, and I use the

12 02:56:44   BOQ productivity of 812.5 metre cubed per day of G7.

13 02:56:50       Then the disagreement between the experts is on

14 02:56:53   window 9a, 9b and 10, and the disagreement on --

15 02:57:01   although the critical path in 9a and 9b are in

16 02:57:05   section 7.  But the disagreement is primarily coming

17 02:57:09   from the causes of delay.  In 9a Mr Cookson says there

18 02:57:14   are some additional quantities which gives 37 days of

19 02:57:17   delay, and in my view the delay is because of the slow

20 02:57:21   progress.

21 02:57:22       And in 9b -- and of course in 9a also, Mr Cookson

22 02:57:25   also says some 24 days of delay coming from the

23 02:57:29   so-called dilution of resources, the competition of

24 02:57:32   resources which is there between various activities

25 02:57:35   within section 7 and also ATR road.  He also assigned


                                     147






 1 02:57:45   some delay in those 24 days to heavy rainfall and then

 2 02:57:49   of course some four and a half days he agreed no work

 3 02:57:52   was being undertaken for unknown reasons.

 4 02:57:54       In 9b, primarily the reason is more or less kind of

 5 02:57:57   broadly agreed.  He says that the delay is because of

 6 02:58:01   dilution of resources.  I say that the resources had

 7 02:58:05   been allocated on non-critical activities, so therefore

 8 02:58:10   there is a delay in window 9b.  So broadly I believe

 9 02:58:13   that the reasons could be considered as same.

10 02:58:20       Then window 10, which is the last window between

11 02:58:22   August 2024 to December, the difference is coming mainly

12 02:58:26   because Mr Cookson says that the ATR road marking works

13 02:58:30   were primarily critical and he assigns the delays to the

14 02:58:35   ATR road marking and of course some other ancillary

15 02:58:38   works.

16 02:58:38       I am saying that a lot of works are going slow,

17 02:58:44   slagging issues and stone pitching issues, crack issues

18 02:58:48   and main road marking issues and all, so that's the main

19 02:58:52   difference between the two experts.

20 02:58:57       Next slide.

21 02:58:57       This is my alternate analysis wherein I have taken

22 02:59:01   the productivity as per the rev 0 baseline and you will

23 02:59:05   see the disagreement on window 3b, 4, 5a and 5b is again

24 02:59:12   emanating from the same issues, about section 4 getting

25 02:59:15   delayed in the start and section 5 being leapfrogged.


                                     148






 1 02:59:20       But this disagreement reduces in windows 7 and 8,

 2 02:59:28   which was there in the previous primary analysis,

 3 02:59:30   because I have used the same productivity of 812.5 metre

 4 02:59:34   cubed per day on G7 as used by Mr Cookson.

 5 02:59:39       Then the disagreement on window 9a, 9b and 10

 6 02:59:43   continues to be there for the same reasons which were

 7 02:59:46   there in the primary analysis.

 8 02:59:48       So now, if tribunal thinks that the productivity is

 9 02:59:56   BOQ quantity divided by the rev 0 duration, then my

10 03:00:00   primary analysis is there only, because Mr Cookson's

11 03:00:03   analysis is based on 812.5, which is the rev 0

12 03:00:07   productivity.

13 03:00:08       But if tribunal thinks that the productivity of

14 03:00:11   rev 0, which is 812.5, considered by Mr Cookson, is

15 03:00:16   applicable, then there are two analyses in front of the

16 03:00:18   tribunal.  One is Mr Cookson's analysis, one is my

17 03:00:22   alternate analysis.

18 03:00:22       Next slide.

19 03:00:32       These are some of the S curves which I have drawn

20 03:00:35   which the dotted line are -- first of all you will see

21 03:00:38   the vertical lines.  These are all the windows.  The

22 03:00:40   dotted lines are the planned lines for G7.  This is

23 03:00:45   an S curve for the G7.  And the firm lines are for the

24 03:00:52   actual progress of G7.

25 03:00:56       Now, if you will see, there are certain areas and


                                     149






 1 03:00:59   certain time periods where the actual progress of G7

 2 03:01:05   becomes flat, the lines become flat, and specifically

 3 03:01:08   I'll draw your attention to the blue-coloured line in

 4 03:01:15   the period between August 2022 to January 2023.

 5 03:01:21       Yes, this one.  So you'll see it's flat.  This is

 6 03:01:24   section 5, the leapfrogging concept which I'm talking

 7 03:01:29   about.  And likewise you will see that the slopes of the

 8 03:01:31   lines, of the firm lines which are the actual S curves

 9 03:01:36   line, are sometimes less steep as compared to the

10 03:01:41   baseline slope.

11 03:01:42       So the baseline slopes are primarily the

12 03:01:45   productivity of the baseline, vis--vis the actual is

13 03:01:49   the actual productivity.  So therefore you can see at

14 03:01:54   many a times there is less productivity as compared to

15 03:01:58   the baseline productivity, and many a times there is

16 03:02:02   stoppage of work because there is a horizontal line, the

17 03:02:07   firm horizontal lines.

18 03:02:12       And likewise, I will also draw your attention to

19 03:02:15   light-green-coloured line, which is essentially

20 03:02:18   section 4 line, so the dotted line is the baseline, the

21 03:02:22   firm line is the actual, so you can see that the firm

22 03:02:24   line has started somewhere around January 2022 because

23 03:02:28   there was a delay in the start of section 4.

24 03:02:33HE PRESIDENT:  Can I -- Mr Singhal, whenever you talk about

25 03:02:35   the baseline, which I can see are the dotted lines, is


                                     150






 1 03:02:39   that taken from the PoIT or is that taken from the

 2 03:02:44   programme which is in the tender?

 3 03:02:46.  From PoIT rev 0.

 4 03:02:48HE PRESIDENT:  Right.  Thank you.

 5 03:02:50.  Next slide.

 6 03:02:55       Next slide.

 7 03:02:55       So now, sir, I'll go to specifically the windows

 8 03:03:02   wherein there is a disagreement.

 9 03:03:06       So first disagreement is on window 3b and the

10 03:03:09   disagreement is emanating from the fact that Mr Cookson

11 03:03:15   says -- there are two issues which Mr Cookson says.

12 03:03:19   Number one, that section 4 should start once section 3

13 03:03:25   is finished, based on the concept of the baseline, and

14 03:03:28   secondly, the drawings for section 4 came only

15 03:03:32   in December 2021.

16 03:03:35       Now, this particular slide -- and I will take you

17 03:03:38   back to the baseline programme rev 0 wherein the link

18 03:03:46   between section 3 and section 4 is on cut to spoil.

19 03:03:51   This is the only section where the link between

20 03:03:54   section 3 and section 4 is not on G7.  It's on cut to

21 03:03:57   spoil.

22 03:03:59       If you will see, the cut to spoil of section 2 was

23 03:04:03   finished somewhere in March 2021.  The cut to spoil of

24 03:04:06   section 3 was finished somewhere in April 2021.  But the

25 03:04:11   works in section 4 only started somewhere in January


                                     151






 1 03:04:17   2022.  And this is one of the reasons where I prescribe

 2 03:04:22   around 160 days of delay to this particular delay in

 3 03:04:29   start of section 4, and this is one of the reasons why

 4 03:04:31   whatever benefits which are being drawn in the phase one

 5 03:04:35   are being killed, because of this delayed start of

 6 03:04:40   section 4.

 7 03:04:42       And the reason -- next slide.

 8 03:04:47       So the contemporaneous documents which I have

 9 03:04:50   highlighted in this shows that the works were put on

10 03:04:55   hold not because of the sectional completion concept,

11 03:05:00   the sequential completion concept, but because of the

12 03:05:05   lack of administrative order primarily.  And these are

13 03:05:10   some of the contemporaneous documents which are there.

14 03:05:12   And Mr Cookson has his assessment which says that the

15 03:05:15   resources were fully utilised in phase one and the late

16 03:05:19   completion of G7 in phase one, but again the link is

17 03:05:22   between cut to spoil, and I have shown you that the cut

18 03:05:24   to spoil of section 3 was completed in April and the

19 03:05:27   planned start date for section 4 as per the rev 0

20 03:05:32   was August.

21 03:05:36R GILLION:  Just as a timekeeper, he's been going on for

22 03:05:38   17 minutes.  In fairness to the parties, I think we

23 03:05:40   should probably --

24 03:05:40HE PRESIDENT:  No, I had not been keeping an eye on my

25 03:05:43   watch.  You're quite right to remind me.


                                     152






 1 03:05:47       I think that's right.  The tribunal indicated that

 2 03:05:50   it wished to restrain both experts to 15 minutes each.

 3 03:05:54   I think I will give you one more minute so you can wrap

 4 03:05:59   up, but not beyond that.

 5 03:06:01.  Great, okay.

 6 03:06:02       Then window 4b, next slide, this primarily the

 7 03:06:05   reason is the abandonment of section 5, which I have

 8 03:06:08   already explained.

 9 03:06:09       Next slide.

10 03:06:11       The window 7, 8, 9a, the difference is on the

11 03:06:15   critical path.  ATR and section 7 are there.  I don't

12 03:06:20   think ATR is on the critical path.  Next slide.

13 03:06:26       And I have assigned some bit of delay in 7, 8, 9

14 03:06:29   because of the slow progress but I have also assigned

15 03:06:32   delays because of extra material which is on the cut to

16 03:06:35   spoil.

17 03:06:36       Next slide.

18 03:06:37       Window 9b, there is an issue of the so-called

19 03:06:40   dilution of resources but I don't see that because I see

20 03:06:43   that the resources are idle/parked.

21 03:06:49       Next slide.

22 03:06:50       Window 10 is those last-minute last issues where

23 03:06:53   this entire works were to be done in 12 months, and it's

24 03:06:56   taken three and a half months.

25 03:06:58       My last slide is acceleration.  I have not seen any


                                     153






 1 03:07:01   assessment of acceleration through the

 2 03:07:05   as-planned/as-built delay analysis where an acceleration

 3 03:07:08   should come as a minus figure in the windows.  That is

 4 03:07:11   not there and it is done on a very oversimplistic

 5 03:07:15   manner.

 6 03:07:15       Thank you, sir.  That brings me to the end of the

 7 03:07:17   presentation.

 8 03:07:18HE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you.

 9 03:07:19       If you wait there, I'm sure there will be some

10 03:07:21   questions for you.

11 03:07:22.  Yes, sir.

12 03:07:28               Cross-examination by MR CHAN

13 03:07:34R CHAN:  Good afternoon, Mr Singhal.

14 03:07:34.  Good afternoon.

15 03:07:34.  Just as an introduction first, I am Chan Yong Neng,

16 03:07:37   counsel for the claimant and I will have some questions

17 03:07:40   for you this afternoon.

18 03:07:41       Some general questions first.  So, Mr Singhal, you

19 03:07:42   are here before the tribunal today as an independent

20 03:07:44   expert; is that correct?

21 03:07:45.  Correct.

22 03:07:45.  And you were engaged to provide independent opinion?

23 03:07:50.  Correct.

24 03:07:50.  You are comfortable that the contents in your expert

25 03:07:52   reports and the appendices filed in these proceedings


                                     154






 1 03:07:57   represent your independent views?

 2 03:07:58.  Yes, I confirm.

 3 03:07:59.  Thank you, Mr Singhal.

 4 03:08:03       The methodology that you have selected is the

 5 03:08:10   as-planned versus as-built methodology, correct?

 6 03:08:12.  Correct.

 7 03:08:12.  Just to confirm that.

 8 03:08:13       In terms of industry guidance, one of the industry

 9 03:08:16   commentaries that you have referred to is the

10 03:08:18   SCL Protocol.  Would you agree that you consider the

11 03:08:21   SCL Protocol to be helpful guidance on good practices

12 03:08:24   for delay analysis?

13 03:08:25.  Yes, I agree.

14 03:08:27.  Thank you, Mr Singhal.

15 03:08:27       I wonder, because you use the APAB -- I will just

16 03:08:35   call it the APAB method for short -- I want to start

17 03:08:39   first by helping the tribunal appreciate the baselines

18 03:08:43   that you have used.  I will start first with your first

19 03:08:46   report.

20 03:08:48       I'll pull up RSD-1, for the record, paragraph 243 to

21 03:08:56   244.  Just have a quick read through it to refresh your

22 03:08:59   memory of these paragraphs.

23 03:09:05       I just wanted to give clarity to how you have

24 03:09:09   prepared your baseline for your first report.

25 03:09:11       Mr Singhal, you have first identified PoIT rev 0 as


                                     155






 1 03:09:15   setting out the initial work plan for the project; is

 2 03:09:17   that correct?

 3 03:09:20.  Correct.

 4 03:09:21.  But you have not used the contemporaneous PoIT rev 0 as

 5 03:09:24   a baseline, you have made adjustments to both the

 6 03:09:27   quantities and durations in PoIT rev 0; is that correct?

 7 03:09:32.  Yes, that was for report number 1, but that has been

 8 03:09:36   modified and is no more used in subsequent reports, ie

 9 03:09:39   report number 2.

10 03:09:41.  So, Mr Singhal, because -- that is a very interesting

11 03:09:45   comment, because your first report is still part of the

12 03:09:47   record and I didn't understand that you are no longer

13 03:09:49   relying on it.

14 03:09:50       If you are confirming that you are no longer relying

15 03:09:52   on your first analysis, I can drop all my questions on

16 03:09:55   your first report?

17 03:09:56.  I think yes, you can go to my second report wherein my

18 03:09:59   analysis is modified, although the difference between

19 03:10:01   the two reports would not be big, but my second analysis

20 03:10:05   takes care of all the issues which you are right now

21 03:10:08   mentioning, like the bifurcation of the quantities, etc.

22 03:10:13.  So, Mr Singhal, are you standing by the first report

23 03:10:15   that you have filed?

24 03:10:18.  I have updated my analysis in my second report.

25 03:10:21.  I'm trying to understand, you have filed a few reports.


                                     156






 1 03:10:23   I'm trying to give clarity to the tribunal on what use

 2 03:10:28   they can make of your first report.  Do you still

 3 03:10:30   consider the analysis done in your first report to be

 4 03:10:32   accurate?

 5 03:10:33.  The analysis done in my first report is superseded by

 6 03:10:39   the analysis done in my second report.

 7 03:10:40.  So do you consider that the tribunal should ignore the

 8 03:10:43   first report then?

 9 03:10:44.  Specifically the analysis part, yes, that can be

10 03:10:46   ignored.

11 03:10:47.  Okay, thank you, Mr Singhal.  I will focus on your

12 03:10:51   second report then.

13 03:10:58       We'll move on to another parameter that you have

14 03:11:01   used in your analysis first and that's production rates.

15 03:11:03       So, Mr Singhal, you refer to several G7 fill

16 03:11:10   production rates in your report.  Let's start with the

17 03:11:13   highest G7 production rate that you reference first.

18 03:11:16       I'll pull up the first joint report of the delay

19 03:11:19   experts, that's DJER1, paragraph 12.3.14.  If you can

20 03:11:27   see that on the screen?  This is the section where you

21 03:11:30   express your view on production rates.

22 03:11:35       Here you say:

23 03:11:37       "... the following production rates prevail over all

24 03:11:41   others."

25 03:11:41       Very strong words.


                                     157






 1 03:11:43       And for G7 fuel, according to your analysis, the

 2 03:11:45   production rate that prevails over others is either

 3 03:11:46   4,250 or -- 4,250 per gang or 1,820 per day.

 4 03:12:00       First of all, Mr Singhal, both of these production

 5 03:12:03   rates were never expressly stated in any document in the

 6 03:12:06   project; is that correct?

 7 03:12:14.  The production rate of 442.71 is derived from the

 8 03:12:19   Table D.  Production rate of 4,250 is also derived from

 9 03:12:23   Table D.  And then of course the BOQ and tender

10 03:12:27   programmes, 1,820 is also derived from that, and I have

11 03:12:32   given the footnotes to explain how they have come from.

12 03:12:37.  Thank you, I just wanted to confirm that that is the

13 03:12:39   case.  So would it be right that both the production

14 03:12:41   rates of 4,250 and 1,820 for G7 is not stated in any

15 03:12:46   document and both were derived; is that correct?

16 03:12:53.  Yes.  So Table D does give the parameters how you can

17 03:12:56   calculate.  So if you go to the footnote 371, you will

18 03:13:07   see from where it is derived from.

19 03:13:09       Now, whether you say that the word or the figure

20 03:13:11   4,250 is not stated in any of the document, you are

21 03:13:15   right.  But the derivation is derived from the Table D.

22 03:13:19.  My understanding is right then, we are aligned, that

23 03:13:21   these are derived rates, Mr Singhal.

24 03:13:25       The first prevailing production rate that you

25 03:13:27   suggest is 4,250 per day per gang, but you suggest


                                     158






 1 03:13:34   a higher production rate than your other prevailing rate

 2 03:13:37   of overall 1,820 per day.

 3 03:13:41       So my question, Mr Singhal, is: it is impossible for

 4 03:13:46   one gang to have a higher production rate than the

 5 03:13:51   overall production rate for a day; would you agree?

 6 03:14:00.  Could you explain the question again?  I couldn't

 7 03:14:01   understand.  Do I have the transcript?

 8 03:14:04.  I will repeat my question so that --

 9 03:14:07.  Can I have the transcript here?

10 03:14:09.  Yes, I think it got cut out.

11 03:14:09.  No, it's not there on the transcript.

12 03:14:15HE PRESIDENT:  Operator, I think the witness is saying that

13 03:14:16   the transcript is not working on his laptop.  Perhaps

14 03:14:19   you could take a look.

15 03:14:30R CHAN:  Is it not running?

16 03:14:31.  No. (Pause)

17 03:14:42       You can continue maybe.  If you can repeat the

18 03:14:42   question?  Meanwhile they can --

19 03:14:43R CHAN:  I think we can wait if it's quick; I'd prefer for

20 03:14:44   you to have the benefit of the transcript as well, just

21 03:14:46   so you can follow.

22 03:14:47HE PRESIDENT:  For what it's worth, operator, it's running

23 03:14:49   on my laptop so it's a problem with Mr Singhal's laptop

24 03:14:52   I think, rather than the transcript per se.

25 03:14:55       There's no transcript coming up on your laptop?


                                     159






 1 03:15:06.  No.

 2 03:15:06HE PRESIDENT:  I suspect he's clicked a button or something

 3 03:15:07   and --

 4 03:15:08ECHNICIAN:  I didn't put any transcript, sir, since Day 1.

 5 03:15:11HE PRESIDENT:  Oh, okay, I didn't know that.

 6 03:15:12       I think it's sensible that the witness has the

 7 03:15:15   transcript.

 8 03:15:16R CHAN:  Yes, I would prefer for Mr Singhal as well to have

 9 03:15:19   the transcript.  Can we arrange for the transcript to be

10 03:15:22   shown on the screen as well?  Because I think Mr Singhal

11 03:15:24   has the exhibit screen already.  So we could use this

12 03:15:27   for the transcript.

13 03:15:46       (Pause)

14 03:16:45.  Thank you very much.

15 03:16:46.  Do you have the transcript?

16 03:16:47.  Yes, now I have.  Thank you very much.

17 03:16:49.  So I will try my question again.

18 03:16:51       So we are looking at two rates which you have

19 03:16:53   presented as rates that prevail over all others.  So I'm

20 03:16:57   trying to understand how they reconcile with one

21 03:17:02   another.

22 03:17:02       You will see that the first prevailing rate that you

23 03:17:04   suggested is 4,250 per day per gang, which means if

24 03:17:09   there's two gangs it will be higher.

25 03:17:11       The second prevailing rate that you have suggested


                                     160






 1 03:17:15   is 1,820 per day.

 2 03:17:17       So my question is that it is impossible for one gang

 3 03:17:22   to have a higher production rate than the overall

 4 03:17:26   production rate for a day; would you agree?

 5 03:17:39.  Correct.

 6 03:17:40.  So Mr Singhal, would you also agree then that these two

 7 03:17:43   rates that you suggest prevail over all others are

 8 03:17:46   inconsistent?

 9 03:17:52.  Yes.

10 03:17:52.  Thank you, Mr Singhal.

11 03:17:54       Let's dive in in more detail on the first -- the

12 03:17:58   higher rate that you propose first.  You mentioned this

13 03:18:01   rate is derived from Table D in the breakdown of prices;

14 03:18:05   is that correct?

15 03:18:06.  Correct.

16 03:18:07.  I'm going to -- some general questions first.

17 03:18:13       You did not mention or derive such a rate from

18 03:18:16   Table D in your first report; is that right?

19 03:18:22.  I don't remember, but if you are saying, it should be

20 03:18:25   okay.  But anyways, this rate is not used in my

21 03:18:28   analysis, so.  But yes, I don't remember what is

22 03:18:31   mentioned in my first report.  But I have not used it in

23 03:18:34   my analysis.

24 03:18:35.  Do you consider this rate to be reasonable, Mr Singhal?

25 03:18:40.  See, this is the rate coming from Table D, which is the


                                     161






 1 03:18:44   input to the bill of quantity rates which are given in

 2 03:18:47   the contract.

 3 03:18:47       Now, definitely there is contradiction between the

 4 03:18:55   productivity of the equipment vis--vis productivity of

 5 03:18:59   the operator.

 6 03:18:59       Now, it is a legal issue for the tribunal to decide

 7 03:19:02   whether, in the event of the contradiction, which is the

 8 03:19:05   right productivity rate to be utilised.

 9 03:19:10       The price of the BOQ is coming based on 4,250 metre

10 03:19:17   cubed per day.

11 03:19:19.  Mr Singhal, because you have presented this rate as

12 03:19:21   a rate that prevails over all others, I'm trying to

13 03:19:24   understand what your assessment of this rate is.

14 03:19:26       I guess a more general question first.  Do you think

15 03:19:29   in your role as an independent expert, it would be

16 03:19:32   relevant for you to consider whether a production rate

17 03:19:37   is reasonable?

18 03:19:39.  So for that reason I have not used 4,250.  I have used

19 03:19:43   two other rates in my analysis.  One is the BOQ quantity

20 03:19:46   divided by the baseline duration, and in the second

21 03:19:50   analysis I have used the rev 0 production rate.

22 03:19:56.  Let me ask you more directly then.  Do you consider the

23 03:19:58   rate of 4,250 per day per gang for G7 to be a reasonable

24 03:20:03   rate?

25 03:20:10.  It can be on two scenarios.  The rate given using the


                                     162






 1 03:20:17   equipment, the productivity rates given in Table D using

 2 03:20:23   the equipment comes to 4,250.  But definitely there is

 3 03:20:26   a contradiction with respect to the equipment and the

 4 03:20:28   operator who is going to operate that equipment.

 5 03:20:32       Now, the challenge here is this rate of 4,250 is

 6 03:20:37   getting into the pricing.  Now, if I use the rate given

 7 03:20:43   by the operator, the productivity derived from the

 8 03:20:46   operator, then my BOQ rate becomes incorrect.  But as

 9 03:20:52   a delay analyst, I have not used either of them.

10 03:20:56.  You've presented this as a potential prevailing rate.

11 03:21:00   I'm just trying to assist the tribunal in understanding

12 03:21:02   your view on something very specific and I'm just going

13 03:21:05   to repeat the question because you haven't answered it.

14 03:21:08   We'll come on to the inconsistencies between the

15 03:21:10   operator and the grader; you seem quite excited about

16 03:21:13   that.

17 03:21:13       My question is: having studied the project and as

18 03:21:16   an independent expert, do you consider the rate of 4,250

19 03:21:20   per day per gang for G7 to be a reasonable rate to apply

20 03:21:24   for this project?

21 03:21:28.  No, I would not consider it reasonable, subject to me

22 03:21:32   completely ignoring the BOQ rates, subject to maybe

23 03:21:37   a hypothetical error in deriving that BOQ rates.  If

24 03:21:43   those two subjective issues are there, then of course

25 03:21:47   4,250 is not there.


                                     163






 1 03:21:49       Saying so, I can do see that the tender programme

 2 03:21:53   rates are different.  The rev 0 rates are much lower.

 3 03:21:57   The operator rates are lower.  So in light of all that,

 4 03:22:00   4,250 seems to be unreasonable.  But we can't ignore the

 5 03:22:03   fact that these are derived from the norms of the

 6 03:22:10   claimant, basis which the BOQ rate is coming.

 7 03:22:15.  If the tribunal were to have to select a production rate

 8 03:22:19   to assess whether the contractor has delivered the

 9 03:22:23   project on time, do you think it would be reasonable for

10 03:22:28   them to use the rate of 4,250?

11 03:22:31.  So that is something which will be more of a legal

12 03:22:34   issue, but I have not used 4,250 in my delay analysis

13 03:22:38   because, the reason why I will say it's a legal issue,

14 03:22:42   because the BOQ rates are coming from 4,250.

15 03:22:47.  Okay, you mentioned the inconsistency between a rate

16 03:22:51   derived for operator and grader, so let's get into that.

17 03:22:55   I'm going to pull up DJER2-RS-3, and that's an appendix

18 03:23:02   that you prepared that was appended to the second joint

19 03:23:05   report of the delay experts.

20 03:23:08       Are you familiar with this document, Mr Singhal?

21 03:23:10.  Yes.

22 03:23:13.  So I have a couple of questions arising from this

23 03:23:15   appendix 8 that you prepared.

24 03:23:23       I'll start by zooming in at the blue box first.

25 03:23:27       Let me try to display the full text for you so you


                                     164






 1 03:23:32   can see it properly.  I just want to make sure you are

 2 03:23:46   able to read it.

 3 03:23:47       I just want to walk through some calculations that

 4 03:23:50   you have done in this appendix using Table D.

 5 03:23:55       First, your calculations derive a production rate of

 6 03:23:58   4,250 per day for equipment, namely the grader; is that

 7 03:24:01   correct?

 8 03:24:03.  Correct.

 9 03:24:07.  Second, your calculations derive a production rate of

10 03:24:10   about 659 per day for an operator operating a grader; is

11 03:24:13   that correct?

12 03:24:14.  Correct.

13 03:24:15.  So, Mr Singhal, it is impossible for a grader to produce

14 03:24:19   4,250 cubic metres of fill a day if a grader operator

15 03:24:24   can only produce 659 cubic metres per day; would you

16 03:24:29   agree?

17 03:24:30.  Correct.

18 03:24:34.  So further in this appendix that you prepared, you say

19 03:24:36   that:

20 03:24:36       "... to make it sensible --"

21 03:24:38       I'm just going to scroll down a bit so you can read

22 03:24:40   it.

23 03:24:40       In this appendix that you prepared, you say that:

24 03:24:45       "... to make it sensible, realistic and

25 03:24:48   a possibility, the only way is to consider the operator


                                     165






 1 03:24:51   hours as correct and use the same in their respective

 2 03:24:53   equipment."

 3 03:24:55       So, Mr Singhal, you are suggesting that to make

 4 03:25:00   sense of the Table D rates, the derived production rate

 5 03:25:04   of 4,250 of the grader should be adjusted down to the

 6 03:25:08   production rate derived for the operator, which is 659;

 7 03:25:12   is that correct?

 8 03:25:14.  Yes, that seems to be more realistic, as you just now

 9 03:25:18   pointed out that can an equipment operate at 4,250 while

10 03:25:21   the operator of the same equipment is operating at

11 03:25:25   658.92.  So you're right.  That's what I have written.

12 03:25:32.  Thank you.  When you derived these production rates in

13 03:25:34   your second report, did you highlight this inconsistency

14 03:25:37   to the tribunal?

15 03:25:38.  No, because, as I said, my analysis is based on two

16 03:25:42   scenarios.  One is the UNRA, and one is the rev 0.  So

17 03:25:48   whether it is 4,250.  So whether it is 4,250 or 658.92,

18 03:25:50   I have not used that.  I have assessed on two bases,

19 03:25:55   which I have explained in my presentation just now.

20 03:26:00.  I'm just going to scroll up.  I will use your own words.

21 03:26:06   You say it's a "grave error" here.  So as an independent

22 03:26:11   expert do you not consider it necessary to highlight

23 03:26:14   such a grave error to the tribunal when you were

24 03:26:17   suggesting the rate of 4,250?

25 03:26:22.  So this is what I have done.  I'm highlighting this is


                                     166






 1 03:26:25   a grave error.

 2 03:26:26.  Okay, in your --

 3 03:26:27HE PRESIDENT:  Sorry, just to check, this is Mr Singhal's

 4 03:26:29   document, isn't it?

 5 03:26:31R CHAN:  Yes, sir.

 6 03:26:33HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

 7 03:26:34R CHAN:  I'm just asking him about the timing of his

 8 03:26:37   presentation of the rates.  So he has confirmed that he

 9 03:26:40   didn't present 4,250 in the first report.  In the second

10 03:26:44   report he presented 4,250.  And this is an appendix that

11 03:26:48   he appended to the second joint report, which was just

12 03:26:51   filed a week ago.  Just to sort of put a marker in terms

13 03:26:55   of timing.

14 03:26:56       It's not a big issue.  I don't need to spend too

15 03:26:58   much time on it.

16 03:27:01HE PRESIDENT:  So the criticism is whilst he did mention it

17 03:27:03   in this, you're putting to him he should have mentioned

18 03:27:07   it elsewhere as well?

19 03:27:09R CHAN:  Yes, Mr President.

20 03:27:10.  I believe it is mentioned somewhere in one of the

21 03:27:12   reports.  I don't remember precisely whether it is in

22 03:27:16   earlier joint statement or not, but I have mentioned

23 03:27:18   that there is this discrepancy and Mr Cookson has also

24 03:27:23   mentioned this.

25 03:27:25       But here what I'm trying to highlight in this


                                     167






 1 03:27:27   particular document is that in the event we shelve

 2 03:27:33   4,250 metre cubed per day of productivity, the unit rate

 3 03:27:37   of the BOQ becomes wrong and the value -- and the unit

 4 03:27:44   rate becomes almost quite high.  And therefore the total

 5 03:27:48   value of the contract and the unit rate of the G7

 6 03:27:55   becomes incorrect.

 7 03:27:58.  Thank you, Mr Singhal.

 8 03:28:00       So you mentioned the rate that you used is the rate

 9 03:28:05   of 1,473 cubic metres per day.

10 03:28:11.  Correct.

11 03:28:12.  This production rate is a production rate used by UNRA

12 03:28:14   in their EOT assessment in AO number 9; is that correct?

13 03:28:19.  Correct.

14 03:28:20.  So this was dated 24 July 2023 and the arbitration had

15 03:28:25   already commenced.  Were you already engaged by the

16 03:28:28   Republic of Uganda at this point in time, Mr Singhal?

17 03:28:32.  Yes.  My first report has gone on 28 June 2024.

18 03:28:37.  So you were engaged after --

19 03:28:38.  Sorry -- yes, so I was not engaged at this point of

20 03:28:41   time.

21 03:28:42.  Mr Singhal, have you seen the rate of 1,473 stated in

22 03:28:47   any documents or any programmes in the project other --

23 03:28:50   before AO9?

24 03:28:55.  The most relevant programme is of course rev 0.  The

25 03:28:59   rev 0 has a rate of 812.5, which is coming from the


                                     168






 1 03:29:03   quantities derived from the drawing.  But in my view,

 2 03:29:07   which I have explained in the various reports,

 3 03:29:10   a baseline is suitable for durations: start date, finish

 4 03:29:15   date.

 5 03:29:15.  Mr Singhal, I'm sorry, I just had to stop you because

 6 03:29:18   you're not speaking to my question.

 7 03:29:20       My question is: have you seen the rate of 1,473

 8 03:29:25   stated in any other documents or any programmes before

 9 03:29:28   AO9?

10 03:29:29.  No.

11 03:29:30.  Thank you, Mr Singhal.

12 03:29:34       I have some general questions on how production

13 03:29:37   rates function, just to check that we are aligned.

14 03:29:41   Would you agree that if a production rate that is

15 03:29:43   necessary to complete an activity on time is not met,

16 03:29:48   that activity will be delayed?

17 03:29:50.  Correct.

18 03:29:50.  And conversely, if a production rate that is necessary

19 03:29:54   to complete an activity on time is met, the activity

20 03:29:57   will not be delayed?

21 03:30:00.  On a very broad level, yes.

22 03:30:04.  I wanted to look at what the actual progress on the

23 03:30:08   project demonstrates about what production rates would

24 03:30:11   be required on the project.

25 03:30:13       Mr Singhal, both you and Mr Cookson agree -- I think


                                     169






 1 03:30:18   you've mentioned earlier -- from window 1 to window 3a,

 2 03:30:21   there were no critical delays on the project; is that

 3 03:30:24   correct?

 4 03:30:25.  Correct.

 5 03:30:32.  So window 1 to window 3a runs from 1 June 2020 to

 6 03:30:39   7 August 2021.  You can have a quick look.

 7 03:30:43.  Let me check.

 8 03:30:46.  I just wanted to confirm that -- so the project up to

 9 03:30:49   7 August 2021 was being delivered on time?

10 03:30:56.  Yes, there were no critical delays.

11 03:30:59.  Thank you, Mr Singhal.

12 03:31:01       I'm going to pull up one of the appendices to your

13 03:31:04   second report.  This is RSD-2-01 titled "Actual

14 03:31:11   progress".  I'm going to go to tab G7.  Do you recall

15 03:31:17   this appendix, Mr Singhal?

16 03:31:19.  Yes.

17 03:31:21.  I want to zoom in on this period that we have confirmed

18 03:31:23   there was no critical delay on the project.  So I'm just

19 03:31:29   going to draw a blue box to help everybody focus their

20 03:31:32   eye.

21 03:31:54       Just give me a minute, Mr Singhal.  I just want to

22 03:31:57   help everybody focus their eye.

23 03:32:05       Just one quick question first to help the tribunal

24 03:32:08   and everyone on what you present in this chart.

25 03:32:09       I think this chart is representing your assessment


                                     170






 1 03:32:13   of average production rates per month; is that correct,

 2 03:32:16   Mr Singhal?

 3 03:32:17.  Yes.

 4 03:32:19.  And the blue bars represent average productivity rate in

 5 03:32:26   each month?

 6 03:32:27.  Correct.

 7 03:32:27.  If we move all the way to the right, the right-most

 8 03:32:35   axis -- sorry.  I'll repeat the question so it's not

 9 03:32:42   broken.

10 03:32:43       The right-most vertical axis is the scale for

11 03:32:49   production rates starting from 200; is that correct?

12 03:32:55.  Yes.

13 03:32:59.  Okay, so I'm just going to ask whilst we're here so it's

14 03:33:02   not lost, I'm just going to ask you to keep in your mind

15 03:33:06   that there's a green horizontal line running close to

16 03:33:09   about 1,500 or 1,470.  We'll come back to that, just to

17 03:33:15   orientate you around the document.

18 03:33:17       I'm going to scroll back to this window of no delay,

19 03:33:20   if I call it that.

20 03:33:30       So you will see in this 11-month period, Mr Singhal,

21 03:33:35   as I mentioned earlier there is a green line very close

22 03:33:38   to the production rate that you used, 1,473.

23 03:33:42   Mr Singhal, based on your analysis, in only two of the

24 03:33:46   11 months was production rate of 1,473 achieved; is that

25 03:33:51   correct?


                                     171






 1 03:33:53.  Correct.

 2 03:33:55.  And in 9 of the 11 months, the production rate of 1,473

 3 03:34:01   was not achieved?

 4 03:34:03.  Correct.

 5 03:34:07.  Yet, Mr Singhal, you have confirmed your view that

 6 03:34:09   there's no delay in this entire period.

 7 03:34:12       So my question is: will you agree then that the

 8 03:34:17   production rate of 1,473 was not necessary to deliver

 9 03:34:20   the project on time?

10 03:34:21.  No, because the basis what you are saying is a very

11 03:34:25   global and flawed basis.  When you are doing a critical

12 03:34:31   path analysis, even though if your production of 1,420

13 03:34:35   is not met on many of the occasions, but there are some

14 03:34:41   extra quantities also which are being done.  So there is

15 03:34:44   a delay because of non-production, there is some surplus

16 03:34:50   because of extra quantities, and a mix of the two

17 03:34:54   results in non-critical delay, which is agreed between

18 03:34:58   the two experts.

19 03:35:02.  I'm going to try again, Mr Singhal.

20 03:35:03       So we have agreed earlier that if a production rate

21 03:35:07   that is necessary to an activity is not met, that

22 03:35:14   activity will be delayed.  So we've established that.

23 03:35:16   And I'm looking at progress that's not hypothetical.

24 03:35:18   This is your assessment of actual productivities on the

25 03:35:22   project.


                                     172






 1 03:35:23       Maybe let me try and break it down in parts.  If the

 2 03:35:30   G7 production rate from window 1 to the end of 3a was

 3 03:35:33   lower than required, would you agree that delay will

 4 03:35:37   have been caused to the project?

 5 03:35:52.  Yes, subject to no changes in any other conditions.

 6 03:35:54.  Okay.  And where the progress in window 1 to window 3a

 7 03:36:01   did not have the progress at the production rate of

 8 03:36:06   1,473 cubic metre to meet the planned progress, would

 9 03:36:10   you agree that the production rate of 1,473 was not

10 03:36:14   necessary to progress the project as-planned?

11 03:36:20.  No.

12 03:36:22.  You disagree?

13 03:36:23.  I disagree.  And if you want I can explain on a very

14 03:36:28   simplistic basis.  Should I?

15 03:36:30.  Go ahead.

16 03:36:31.  So imagine you have 10 metre cubed of concrete to be

17 03:36:35   done.  Your productivity is 10 metre cubed per day,

18 03:36:41   which means in one day you will be in a position to do

19 03:36:44   10 metre cubed.

20 03:36:46       Your productivity is reduced by 5 metre cubed, which

21 03:36:50   means you need two days.

22 03:36:52       Now -- or rather, vice versa, your productivity is

23 03:37:00   doubled, which means you have half a day, 20 metre cubed

24 03:37:04   means you are able to do in one day.

25 03:37:06       But there is a change in the quantity also which is


                                     173






 1 03:37:09   taking place.  So you have to have a debit and credit of

 2 03:37:12   both the issues to be taken into account to derive on

 3 03:37:16   a very simplistic basis.

 4 03:37:27.  Are you complete?  I just wanted make sure you've

 5 03:37:31   completed your --

 6 03:37:32.  Yes.

 7 03:37:33.  Thanks, Mr Singhal.  So we've seen three production

 8 03:37:37   rates being suggested in your report now.  I'm going to

 9 03:37:40   look at another production rate that features in this

10 03:37:43   arbitration.

11 03:37:45       Mr Singhal, you presented production rates in

12 03:37:47   PoIT rev 0 earlier.  Are you aware of what the

13 03:37:51   production rates stated for G7 fill is in PoIT rev 0?

14 03:38:01.  If I remember the PoIT rev 0 has got the quantities and

15 03:38:04   has got the duration, so divide the quantities by the

16 03:38:07   duration, you come to 812.5.

17 03:38:11.  Okay.

18 03:38:12.  And these quantities are derived from the tender

19 03:38:14   drawings.

20 03:38:22.  Are you aware that PoIT rev 0 was approved?

21 03:38:24.  Yes.

22 03:38:24.  Are you also aware that the production rate of

23 03:38:27   812.5 metre cubed was used in the grant of EOT in AO

24 03:38:31   number 5 in the project?

25 03:38:35.  Yes, it was used in the first EOT, but subsequently in


                                     174






 1 03:38:39   the EOT2 grant the different rate was used and also

 2 03:38:43   I believe there is a contemporaneous document wherein

 3 03:38:46   the respondent has highlighted that the rate needs to be

 4 03:38:51   devised(sic).

 5 03:38:55.  I have a general question --

 6 03:38:56.  Needs to be "revised".  A correction in the [draft]

 7 03:39:05   transcript.

 8 03:39:06.  A general question for you, Mr Singhal.  Would you agree

 9 03:39:08   that if a production rate had been endorsed or used --

10 03:39:13   I'll repeat my question.

11 03:39:13       Would you agree that if a production rate had been

12 03:39:17   used by a contract administrator on a project, the

13 03:39:20   production rate would have been endorsed by the contract

14 03:39:24   administrator?

15 03:39:27.  Yes, at that point of time, but you also have to look in

16 03:39:30   this case the other contemporaneous document, which is

17 03:39:33   the contract administrator asking for a change, the BOQ

18 03:39:38   quantities, and the subsequent EOTs, etc.

19 03:39:41       Anyways, for the tribunal purposes, I have done two

20 03:39:48   analyses, one using the so-called approved rate of

21 03:39:52   rev 0.

22 03:39:54.  Okay.  Will you agree then that -- I appreciate you have

23 03:39:57   presented sort of two analyses.  But will you agree that

24 03:40:00   use of the rate of 1,473 would be contradicted by the

25 03:40:05   approved rate in PoIT rev 0 and use of the rate in AO


                                     175






 1 03:40:10   number 5?

 2 03:40:11.  Yes, because the PO1 is based on 812.5.  The first EOT

 3 03:40:18   grant is also based on the 812.5.  It's the tribunal to

 4 03:40:22   decide which of my two analyses to be used.  My

 5 03:40:25   secondary analysis as my alternate analysis is using

 6 03:40:28   812.5 metre cubed per day.

 7 03:40:32.  Okay, thank you, Mr Singhal.

 8 03:40:33       Now, I want to explore some windows and you

 9 03:40:37   helpfully mentioned there's a couple of windows of

10 03:40:40   particular disagreement between the experts, and one of

11 03:40:42   them is window 3b, basically the window between

12 03:40:47   phase one and phase two.

13 03:40:50       Before I sort of jump into that window, I wanted to

14 03:40:53   again check whether we align on some guiding principles

15 03:40:57   first.

16 03:40:57       You accepted earlier that the SCL Protocol is

17 03:41:06   helpful guidance on good practices for delay analysis

18 03:41:09   and I wanted to pull up one section of it.  This is

19 03:41:11   CL-05, for the record, and I'm going to go to page 37,

20 03:41:15   paragraph 11.2.

21 03:41:22       If you could have a quick read of that paragraph,

22 03:41:24   Mr Singhal.  (Pause)

23 03:41:44.  Okay.

24 03:41:47.  So my question, Mr Singhal: would you agree that

25 03:41:50   irrespective of which method of delay analysis is


                                     176






 1 03:41:52   deployed, the overriding objective should be to ensure

 2 03:41:55   the conclusions derived are sound from a commonsense

 3 03:41:59   perspective?

 4 03:41:59.  Correct.

 5 03:42:04.  I'm just going to ask you to make a mental note here as

 6 03:42:07   well.  The second paragraph mentions that this is

 7 03:42:10   particularly relevant when use of the remaining

 8 03:42:13   durations might produce anomalous results.  I don't need

 9 03:42:18   any evidence on that, I just wanted to put a marker on

10 03:42:21   that.

11 03:42:22       Let's start with your overall approach in terms of

12 03:42:27   identifying critical path in your analysis, and I will

13 03:42:32   now pull up DJER1, the first joint report of the delay

14 03:42:40   experts, paragraph 4.3.4(iii)(b).

15 03:42:57       Here you explain a couple of things in terms of how

16 03:42:59   you choose and assess what's critical on a project, and

17 03:43:04   I wanted to get clarity on sort of your view on the

18 03:43:07   appropriate approach.

19 03:43:17.  Yes.

20 03:43:18.  Just make sure you have the opportunity to read it

21 03:43:20   first.

22 03:43:29       (Pause)

23 03:43:29.  Yes, please.

24 03:43:33.  So your view is that where multiple sections are being

25 03:43:36   progressed, not all of them will be critical; is that


                                     177






 1 03:43:38   correct?

 2 03:43:39.  Correct.

 3 03:43:41.  And you consider that one particular section should be

 4 03:43:43   identified as the project-critical section?

 5 03:43:47.  Correct.

 6 03:43:48.  And how you select the critical section is based on the

 7 03:43:51   section with the longest duration to completion?

 8 03:43:56.  Correct.

 9 03:44:00.  So for ease of reference, I'm going to refer to this

10 03:44:03   approach as the sectional approach, and let's look at

11 03:44:06   some of the conclusions arising from your analysis when

12 03:44:10   we apply this sectional approach.

13 03:44:13       You have a helpful summary table in your second

14 03:44:16   delay report, RSD-2 at paragraph 29 that we'll put on

15 03:44:23   screen as well.

16 03:44:23       So we will see up to window 3a you have assessed

17 03:44:37   that there's no critical delay, so I just want to

18 03:44:40   quickly run through windows 3b to 5b, which you earlier

19 03:44:46   highlighted are windows of particular contention between

20 03:44:52   the experts.

21 03:45:11       Mr Singhal, in each window you have identified one

22 03:45:14   section, one particular section, as the

23 03:45:15   project-critical?

24 03:45:17.  Correct.

25 03:45:18.  All of these windows you have not identified additional


                                     178






 1 03:45:22   G7 quantities as the cause of delay; is that correct?

 2 03:45:25.  Yes.

 3 03:45:27.  Let's zoom in under the first window and at

 4 03:45:30   paragraph 258 of the same report, RSD2, you present

 5 03:45:40   a planned versus actual graph.

 6 03:45:51.  Yes.

 7 03:45:51.  We might look at a couple of these.  So again to help

 8 03:45:55   orientate what you present in the graph, this graph

 9 03:46:00   charts as-planned quantities against progress; is that

10 03:46:02   right?

11 03:46:05.  Correct.

12 03:46:08.  And you have assigned a specific colour to each of the

13 03:46:11   seven sections of the road?

14 03:46:12.  Each of the four sections in this graph.

15 03:46:14.  Okay, in this graph, each of the four sections?

16 03:46:16.  Yes.

17 03:46:17.  I think you confirmed earlier the dotted lines represent

18 03:46:20   your analysis of the planned quantity over the planned

19 03:46:23   durations for each section based on PoIT rev 0?

20 03:46:26.  Correct.

21 03:46:29.  And the bold lines represent your analysis of as-built

22 03:46:33   progress of G7 for each section over time?

23 03:46:37.  Correct.

24 03:46:39.  And the left vertical axis is a measure of progress

25 03:46:42   against the original quantities planned ranging from


                                     179






 1 03:46:46   zero to 240%?

 2 03:46:48.  Correct.  And remember in this, the denominator is the

 3 03:46:53   rev 0 514,000 quantities.

 4 03:46:56.  Yes.  So in this window 3b, we see four sections are

 5 03:47:03   being progressed.  Sections 1, 2 and 3 are indicated by

 6 03:47:06   the two red lines, and the yellow line; is that correct?

 7 03:47:11.  Correct.

 8 03:47:15.  And in this particular window, sections 1, 2 and 3 were

 9 03:47:19   progressing quantities above the original quantities

10 03:47:22   planned; is that correct?

11 03:47:24.  Correct.

12 03:47:27.  So additional quantities were being performed in all of

13 03:47:29   these three sections.

14 03:47:36.  Yes.

15 03:47:36.  And for section 3, the yellow, G7 quantities were being

16 03:47:40   progressed in this window to as high as 200% of the

17 03:47:46   original quantities.

18 03:47:49.  Correct.

19 03:47:52.  Applying your sectional approach, Mr Singhal, your

20 03:47:55   conclusion for this window is that a critical

21 03:48:01   section driving delays was section 4, in green.  Is that

22 03:48:04   correct?

23 03:48:07.  Yes.

24 03:48:10.  Mr Singhal, my very general question is: isn't it

25 03:48:14   obvious that significant time and effort was being spent


                                     180






 1 03:48:17   by Strabag in this window to progress additional

 2 03:48:22   quantities in the three sections?

 3 03:48:36.  So, no, because if you see my section 1 and section 2,

 4 03:48:44   section 2 is almost flat, horizontal.  Section 1, the

 5 03:48:54   change is by around 20% or so.  Section 3 was flat, then

 6 03:48:59   started some work, then flat, then started some work and

 7 03:49:03   went up to finish.

 8 03:49:07       So whether -- I would not say that significant time

 9 03:49:09   and effort was being spent.  That will be slightly, you

10 03:49:12   know, an erroneous term.  But from a critical path

11 03:49:17   perspective, I have explained that section 4 is

12 03:49:19   critical.

13 03:49:23.  So, Mr Singhal, in terms of the time and efforts of

14 03:49:26   Strabag in this window, what is your view in terms of

15 03:49:30   the works that this time and effort was being spent on?

16 03:49:43HE PRESIDENT:  I'm sorry, I don't understand that question.

17 03:49:46R CHAN:  My question is: in this window 3b, Mr Singhal, in

18 03:49:53   terms of the time and efforts that Strabag spent to

19 03:49:58   deliver G7 works, where were those work being performed?

20 03:50:06.  So that is evident from the graphs.  So you can see

21 03:50:11   primarily in this window, if I'll say the maximum

22 03:50:16   efforts were being spent on section 3, because that's

23 03:50:19   the only section which you can see is having some kind

24 03:50:23   of a progress from almost near 100% to almost close to

25 03:50:30   around 210%.


                                     181






 1 03:50:38.  So you've just confirmed that in section 3b in this

 2 03:50:41   window, section 3 in particular, progress went from 100%

 3 03:50:48   to as high as 210%.

 4 03:50:53.  Yes.

 5 03:50:54.  So will you agree then that that would have been the

 6 03:50:59   proper section holding up Strabag's ability to work on

 7 03:51:05   other sections?

 8 03:51:06.  No.

 9 03:51:08.  No?

10 03:51:09.  No.

11 03:51:09.  You disagree?

12 03:51:13       Let me put it to you another way, Mr Singhal.

13 03:51:17   Selection of section 4 as critical would ignore the work

14 03:51:22   being done by Strabag on the three other sections; would

15 03:51:25   you agree?

16 03:51:26.  No.  So if you see in this graph there is a plan to

17 03:51:31   start section 4 somewhere in August 2021.  In actual, as

18 03:51:36   we all know, the section 4 started somewhere around

19 03:51:39   19 January 2022.

20 03:51:42       Now -- so what is happening is, even though extra

21 03:51:48   quantities have been performed in 1, 2 and 3, this delay

22 03:51:53   in the start of section 4 has killed whatever benefits

23 03:52:00   which might have come -- first of all, whether the

24 03:52:04   benefits have come or not is something which needs to be

25 03:52:06   discussed because both the experts agree that in prior


                                     182






 1 03:52:09   windows, window 3 and all, there is no critical delay,

 2 03:52:13   and neither the APAB showing any acceleration.

 3 03:52:16       But whatever benefit might be coming in this portion

 4 03:52:19   of window 3b, the delay in the start of section 4 has

 5 03:52:24   eaten away all those benefits, and that's where, if you

 6 03:52:28   come to my slide number 9, you will see that the link of

 7 03:52:36   the baseline was cut to spoil between section 3 to

 8 03:52:39   section 4.  Section 3 cut to spoil was finished in April

 9 03:52:43   2021.  Contemporaneous documents are being written by

10 03:52:47   the respondent, "Please start phase two, section 4" and

11 03:52:53   all, but the section 4 was not started and the

12 03:52:55   contemporaneous documents are showing because of the

13 03:52:57   non-formalisation of the administrative orders.

14 03:53:03HE PRESIDENT:  I'm just conscious of having another break

15 03:53:05   for the transcriber at some point and I don't want to

16 03:53:09   interrupt your flow at all.  Frankly again, I didn't

17 03:53:12   look at the clock so it's my fault we're a little late

18 03:53:15   with it.

19 03:53:15       By all means, if you want to carry on for a couple

20 03:53:19   of minutes and then stop, do that.  If now is a good

21 03:53:22   time to stop, we can do that.

22 03:53:35R CHAN:  Maybe just five to ten minutes for me to finish

23 03:53:38   off this window, if that's okay with the tribunal.

24 03:53:40HE PRESIDENT:  Let's pause now.

25 03:53:41R CHAN:  Okay, let's break now.


                                     183






 1 03:53:41HE PRESIDENT:  Let's pause there.

 2 03:53:41       So it's 15.53.  Let's come back, please, at between

 3 03:53:48   5 and 10 past -- well, okay.  Let's come back at 4.10 to

 4 03:53:58   give our transcriber a little more time.  4.10, please.

 5 03:54:073.54 pm)

 6 03:54:12                     (A short break)

 7 04:10:064.10 pm)

 8 04:10:08HE PRESIDENT:  It's 4.10.  Fire away.

 9 04:10:11R CHAN:  Thank you, Mr President.

10 04:10:13       Good afternoon again, Mr Singhal.

11 04:10:17       I will just come back to the graph that was

12 04:10:19   displayed on screen earlier that we were at.

13 04:10:33       Apologies, Mr Singhal, just bear with me for

14 04:10:33   a minute because we were disconnected and we are

15 04:10:36   reconnecting very shortly.  (Pause)

16 04:11:23       Mr Singhal, just to, I guess in a snapshot,

17 04:11:26   understand your assessment in window 3b, is your

18 04:11:31   assessment that Strabag should have commenced section 4

19 04:11:36   by 31 July 2021 as planned?

20 04:11:41.  Yes.  So as per the planned date of 11 August,

21 04:11:46   I believe, 11 August 2021, because the -- you can see on

22 04:11:54   my presentation, slide number 9, my explanation on that.

23 04:12:06.  One of Mr Cookson's concerns raised with your approach

24 04:12:08   is he suggested that you assumed infinite resource.

25 04:12:13       Mr Singhal, in this window, do you assess whether


                                     184






 1 04:12:16   there were any resource constraints preventing Strabag

 2 04:12:19   from starting another section in parallel?

 3 04:12:21.  Yes.  That's clear from slide 9 of my presentation.

 4 04:12:25.  So you consider there to be no resource constraints in

 5 04:12:30   this window preventing Strabag from commencing

 6 04:12:33   section 4; is that your evidence?

 7 04:12:36.  Correct, because the resources of section 3 got free

 8 04:12:40   somewhere around March, April.  The resources of

 9 04:12:43   section 2 cut to spoil got free around somewhere around

10 04:12:45   March.  So they were completely okay to start

11 04:12:47   from August; number one.

12 04:12:49       Number two, the contemporaneous documents do not

13 04:12:52   highlight resources but highlight the lack of

14 04:12:56   administrative order as the reason for not starting

15 04:12:58   section 4.

16 04:12:59.  We'll get into the SR records around the background to

17 04:13:03   progress of works, but I just wanted to understand from

18 04:13:06   your delay analysis perspective, you are using progress

19 04:13:09   of G7 fill to identify a critical section; is that

20 04:13:15   correct?

21 04:13:15.  Correct.

22 04:13:17.  Do you consider whether there's any resource constraints

23 04:13:20   preventing Strabag from performing G7 works in

24 04:13:23   section 4?

25 04:13:25.  No.  In section 4 when I am looking at the resource


                                     185






 1 04:13:29   constraint, because my resource constraint is from the

 2 04:13:33   start of section 4, and what is the first activity to

 3 04:13:37   start section 4 is the cut to spoil.  So the resource

 4 04:13:40   constraint has to be seen from a cut to spoil

 5 04:13:44   perspective.

 6 04:13:45.  Let me show you a contemporaneous monthly progress

 7 04:13:47   report, Mr Singhal.  This is RSD-1-49.  There's a couple

 8 04:13:53   of pdfs in there.  I'm pulling up in particular

 9 04:13:57   Strabag's November 2021 monthly progress report.  We see

10 04:14:03   the date there.  I'm going to go down to page 50.

11 04:14:16       We'll just zoom in, and this summarises what

12 04:14:19   equipment has been working on which day.

13 04:14:20       You see essentially, whether graders or bulldozers,

14 04:14:25   all of them were working every day in November 2021

15 04:14:28   except for days that they were broken down.

16 04:14:35       My question, Mr Singhal: will you agree that if all

17 04:14:39   graders were already working, there will be no available

18 04:14:42   graders to perform G7 works in that additional section?

19 04:14:50.  No.  So first of all we are talking of August 2021,

20 04:14:54   which is the date on which I said that the section 4

21 04:15:00   should have started.

22 04:15:03       So the issue is that between August to January, you

23 04:15:10   should show me, first of all, the report for August, not

24 04:15:14   for the month of November.  That's number one.

25 04:15:17       Number two, the fact that if they are working is


                                     186






 1 04:15:22   different from the fact that whether the productivity is

 2 04:15:27   there, that's number two, because a grader is shown as

 3 04:15:31   working but is producing maybe 50 metre cubed per day of

 4 04:15:34   G7; that's second thing.

 5 04:15:35       And third thing is we need to look at the cut to

 6 04:15:39   spoil-related relationship between section 3 and

 7 04:15:42   section 4, which I have explained on my slide 9, because

 8 04:15:47   the baseline link between section 3 and section 4 is cut

 9 04:15:51   to spoil.

10 04:15:57.  Mr Singhal, to be very clear, your window 3b is from

11 04:16:00   31 July 2021 to 31 January 2022.  So this November

12 04:16:07   report is right square in that period that you say they

13 04:16:09   should have started G7 at section 4.

14 04:16:12       But let me ask you a more specific question then.

15 04:16:16   Did you review the equipment and plant utilisation

16 04:16:19   recorded in the MPRs from 31 July 2021 to 31 January

17 04:16:25   2022 when performing your analysis?

18 04:16:28.  Yes.

19 04:16:30.  And after reviewing these records, you considered that

20 04:16:34   Strabag still had enough resources to start

21 04:16:36   an additional section?

22 04:16:38.  Yes.

23 04:16:39.  Is that correct?

24 04:16:39.  Correct.  Because if you see my slide 9, the crew for

25 04:16:46   cut to spoil for section 2 and section 3 is free


                                     187






 1 04:16:49   in March 2021.  So then, what is preventing Strabag from

 2 04:16:56   starting section 4?  That's point number one.

 3 04:17:01       Point number two is the contemporaneous evidences,

 4 04:17:05   the letters which have been written by Strabag, the

 5 04:17:08   rev 0 and other programmes, shows that the decision to

 6 04:17:12   hold phase two is not lack of resources; it is the

 7 04:17:15   administrative order.

 8 04:17:17.  No, we'll come to that, Mr Singhal.  I'm trying to get

 9 04:17:20   clarity on the extent of resource analysis you have

10 04:17:24   performed in this window.

11 04:17:26       I pulled up a contemporaneous -- again this is not

12 04:17:29   theoretical, it's a contemporaneous record of November

13 04:17:32   2021, squarely within window 3b where the sole cause of

14 04:17:38   delay you have identified, you say, is failure of

15 04:17:43   Strabag to start works in section 4.

16 04:17:45       You will see from this MPR that all graders, dozers,

17 04:17:49   excavators, etc, are all already working every day of

18 04:17:52   the month.

19 04:17:53       So my question to you, Mr Singhal: if all of

20 04:17:56   Strabag's resources were engaged in the month

21 04:17:59   of November 2021, would you agree that they would not

22 04:18:04   have resources to start section 4?

23 04:18:07.  No, I would not agree.  The reason would be -- let's

24 04:18:11   assume your hypothesis is right.  If all the equipments

25 04:18:16   are being used, does not mean that all the equipments


                                     188






 1 04:18:20   are being used in the required/desired/planned

 2 04:18:24   production, which is either 812.5 or 1,400-something.

 3 04:18:30       What is seen from the contemporaneous record, that

 4 04:18:32   the cut to spoil of section 2 and 3 is finished, so it

 5 04:18:36   could be that because the G7 is being underproductive,

 6 04:18:41   these equipments might have been shifted to G7 or what.

 7 04:18:47       But from a planning perspective, even though the

 8 04:18:49   equipments are utilised, under-utilised could be one

 9 04:18:54   possibility, but the plan shows they should have

10 04:18:56   started, they have not started, and hence the critical

11 04:18:58   delay.

12 04:19:00.  We'll come on to productivity as well.  Where in your

13 04:19:08   report have you performed any resource study to

14 04:19:12   understand whether Strabag has sufficient resources to

15 04:19:18   commence section 4?

16 04:19:19.  I have just explained that for me to look at the

17 04:19:23   resources, I need to understand section 2, 3 completion

18 04:19:26   of cut to spoil.  I see that there is March 2021

19 04:19:30   section 2, 3 resources crews are getting free.  So in

20 04:19:34   that situation, if Strabag is underperforming the works

21 04:19:39   and these resources which are getting free from cut to

22 04:19:42   spoil are transferred to any other underperforming

23 04:19:44   section, that is something which is not required for the

24 04:19:47   purpose of delay analysis.

25 04:19:53.  I'm just conscious I have a lot to cover and these are


                                     189






 1 04:19:56   sort of records in evidence.

 2 04:19:58       I'm just going to move on.  Taking a step back,

 3 04:20:01   Mr Singhal, would you agree that in assessing delays on

 4 04:20:04   a project, one ought to take into account EOTs that have

 5 04:20:07   already been granted on the project?

 6 04:20:19.  So, number one, ideally, yes.  In the event EOT is

 7 04:20:25   granted and the baseline or the planned programme is

 8 04:20:28   revised, then definitely that should be taken into

 9 04:20:31   consideration.  In this specific case, my analysis is

10 04:20:35   right from the plan all the way till the finish and

11 04:20:39   I have done an assessment based on that perspective.

12 04:20:46.  Have you reviewed administrative order number 5 issued

13 04:20:49   on the project?

14 04:20:50.  Yes.

15 04:20:50.  Would you agree that the EOT was granted due to design

16 04:20:53   review and additional G7 quantities?

17 04:20:56.  Correct.

18 04:20:58.  Then, Mr Singhal, would you then agree that your

19 04:21:01   conclusion that additional quantities being performed in

20 04:21:05   window 3b did not cause delay to the project is

21 04:21:10   contradicted by AO number 5?

22 04:21:16.  So AO -- the outcome of EOT of AO5 and my analysis

23 04:21:25   outcomes are different and I have explained in my report

24 04:21:27   that I disagree with the EOT assessment done by the SR.

25 04:21:35   I have done an as-planned/as-built analysis.  The


                                     190






 1 04:21:39   methodology and the concept used by SR is quite

 2 04:21:42   different, and I can explain that what he is doing is

 3 04:21:46   he's saying there is extra quantity for G7, time

 4 04:21:51   required, plus there is extra quantity for rock fill,

 5 04:21:54   plus extra quantity for cut to spoil and he has

 6 04:21:57   considered all this in a sequential manner, which is not

 7 04:22:00   what was the baseline, so therefore I offer a different

 8 04:22:03   view, or my view is that the EOT assessment of SR is

 9 04:22:06   wrong.  But, yes, you are right.  My assessment and

10 04:22:15   assessment in EOT AO5 are contradictory.

11 04:22:18.  You mentioned some of the contemporaneous records in

12 04:22:21   this period so let's explore that.  You expressed a view

13 04:22:25   in your first delay report, RSD-1 at paragraph 406.2 on

14 04:22:39   when you consider Strabag having received the design for

15 04:22:44   phase two and being in a position to proceed.

16 04:23:05       If we quickly just cast our eye down, your

17 04:23:09   assessment of the facts was that the SR on 14 June 2021

18 04:23:14   provided revised geometric drawings, etc, and at 406.3

19 04:23:22   you come to the view that the SR therefore instructed

20 04:23:26   claimant to start phase two essentially.  I just wanted

21 04:23:29   to give your factual assessment as presented in the

22 04:23:32   evidence.

23 04:23:32       I'll now pull up the 14 June 2021 letter that you

24 04:23:36   refer to.  This is exhibit C-88.  Have a quick look and

25 04:23:51   you see the first line in particular:


                                     191






 1 04:23:52       "We are in the process to finalise approval of

 2 04:23:56   changes ... awaiting supervisor's comments ..."

 3 04:24:01       My question is: would you agree that the geometric

 4 04:24:05   design provided by the SR in June 2021 was still pending

 5 04:24:09   approval and comments from the supervisor?

 6 04:24:11.  Yes.

 7 04:24:18.  Mr Singhal, in your professional view, without knowing

 8 04:24:20   what a finalised design would be, would a contractor be

 9 04:24:23   able to proceed with the works?

10 04:24:28.  So it is very much possible and it is done in the

11 04:24:30   industry also.  The issue is whether the final approved

12 04:24:36   drawing is there or not.  I have not seen any changes

13 04:24:41   between June and December 2021 drawings with respect to

14 04:24:46   the start of the work and start of the, you know, phase

15 04:24:51   two-related works.  That's number one.

16 04:24:53       Number two.  With the same design, the phase one is

17 04:24:58   also being executed, and it is now --

18 04:25:02.  I'll stop you there, Mr Singhal.  You are saying that

19 04:25:05   the same design for phase two was being used in

20 04:25:08   phase one.  Is that your evidence?

21 04:25:09.  No, no, so what I am saying is that the design report of

22 04:25:13   phase one and phase two -- this is the detailed design

23 04:25:16   review report which we are talking, the phase one has

24 04:25:19   been executed.  What I am saying is that it is now for

25 04:25:22   the tribunal to decide whether, in absence of


                                     192






 1 04:25:24   a comparison between the June and the December approved

 2 04:25:27   drawing, was the lack of the approval from

 3 04:25:31   an administrative point of view been the cause of not

 4 04:25:36   starting section two or phase two, or was there any

 5 04:25:40   changes in the design?  I don't see that analysis of the

 6 04:25:42   changes in the design.  But I have specified that the

 7 04:25:48   delay in starting phase two was primarily being

 8 04:25:51   highlighted because of the lack of administrative

 9 04:25:53   orders.

10 04:25:55.  You actually haven't answered my question.  I just want

11 04:25:58   to make sure that my understanding of your evidence is

12 04:26:01   right.  In your professional view, are you saying that

13 04:26:03   a contractor would be able to proceed with the works

14 04:26:06   without a finalised design?

15 04:26:07.  Yes, until unless the design is completely erroneous

16 04:26:11   from a complete basic perspectives.

17 04:26:15.  So your professional view is that if a contractor is

18 04:26:18   informed that the design that is shared is not yet to be

19 04:26:21   approved and pending comments, the contractor should

20 04:26:23   proceed to deliver and construct the works based on the

21 04:26:27   provisional design?  Is that your view?

22 04:26:31.  It is possible.  Now it is for the tribunal to decide

23 04:26:35   that if the two drawings are completely erroneous,

24 04:26:40   different and all, then the work cannot be done.  In the

25 04:26:42   industry, it is done.


                                     193






 1 04:26:46.  Very well, Mr Singhal.

 2 04:26:48       I'm going to move forward in time.  So this was June

 3 04:26:53   2021.  Do you know -- I'm going to take you to a letter

 4 04:26:57   first because it was shown to Mr Cookson today.

 5 04:27:00HE PRESIDENT:  Can I just clarify that?

 6 04:27:02       Are you suggesting, Mr Singhal, that a contractor

 7 04:27:05   would be acting unreasonably in not proceeding with the

 8 04:27:08   works whilst the design was up in the air?

 9 04:27:16.  Yes, sir, because if I have got my resources of cut and

10 04:27:21   spoil free in March 2021 and I have the drawings in June

11 04:27:28   2021 -- and remember we are starting cut and spoil,

12 04:27:32   which is not -- you know, it's not a refinery or a very

13 04:27:35   complicated thing, it's just an alignment with levels

14 04:27:38   and all.  So supposedly, if my resources are free,

15 04:27:41   I have drawing which is the so-called not-so-approved

16 04:27:47   drawing, then in such a situation, from a pragmatic

17 04:27:49   point of view, a contractor can start.

18 04:27:52HE PRESIDENT:  No, no doubt a contractor can start if the

19 04:27:56   contractor wants to take the risk of starting.  But are

20 04:27:59   you suggesting that a contractor would be acting

21 04:28:01   unreasonably in saying: I'm not starting until you

22 04:28:05   confirm this design?

23 04:28:06.  I would say yes, because my resources are standing idle.

24 04:28:10HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

25 04:28:14R CHAN:  We will move a couple of months forward in time


                                     194






 1 04:28:17   from June.  Mr Cookson was shown this letter as well,

 2 04:28:21   exhibit C-94.

 3 04:28:30       If we scroll down, if you look at paragraph 3,

 4 04:28:37   Mr Singhal, in circumstances where Strabag had reminded

 5 04:28:53   and asked for a final design but that was still pending

 6 04:28:56   at this stage, do you consider it unreasonable for

 7 04:29:02   Strabag to wait until the final approved design was

 8 04:29:07   approved before commencing the phase two works?

 9 04:29:11.  Yes, I've already explained my position, and plus there

10 04:29:14   are contemporaneous documents from the respondent also

11 04:29:16   on this issue, which is highlighted in my slide 10.

12 04:29:24.  Do you recall when the final design was approved?

13 04:29:27.  Around December 2021.

14 04:29:33.  We looked at your graph for section 3b earlier.  Is it

15 04:29:37   correct that Strabag started the phase two works shortly

16 04:29:43   after on around January 19, 2022; is that correct?

17 04:29:47.  Correct.

18 04:29:48.  Are you aware of when the AO for these design changes

19 04:29:52   were issued?

20 04:29:54.  After 19 January 2022, which means that AO was not the

21 04:29:59   reason for delaying the start.

22 04:30:04.  Thank you, Mr Singhal.

23 04:30:13       Let's move on to the next window, move forward in

24 04:30:18   time, window 4.  I'm going to go back to your

25 04:30:21   as-planned, as-progressed graphs.  The next graph is at


                                     195






 1 04:30:26   paragraph 303 of RSD2, your second delay report.

 2 04:30:42       Are you there, Mr Singhal?

 3 04:30:44.  Which paragraph?

 4 04:30:45.  Paragraph 303 of your second delay report.

 5 04:30:49.  Yes.

 6 04:31:06.  In this window, you see a significant volume of G7

 7 04:31:11   quantities in progress in section 4, indicated in the

 8 04:31:15   bold green line, and the G7 works were being progressed

 9 04:31:19   from 20% to beyond 130% of the original quantities in

10 04:31:26   this window in section 4; is that correct?

11 04:31:46.  Yes.

12 04:31:50.  Your assessment in this window is that section 5,

13 04:31:54   indicated in blue, is the critical section driving the

14 04:31:58   project; is that correct?

15 04:31:59.  Yes.  So you can see from the graphs that very little

16 04:32:03   progress has been done in section 5, and if one

17 04:32:06   section has very good progress, second section has very

18 04:32:09   less progress, the one with less progress is critical.

19 04:32:14.  No, Mr Singhal, this is a similar exercise to the last

20 04:32:18   window.  Would you agree that a significant amount of

21 04:32:20   time and effort of Strabag was being spent on delivering

22 04:32:23   the additional G7 quantities in section 4?

23 04:32:31.  I would not answer this question, because what is the

24 04:32:33   meaning of "significant", "effort", "time" and all?

25 04:32:38   From a delay perspective, you know, these words need to


                                     196






 1 04:32:42   be slightly more quantified.

 2 04:32:44.  Okay.  You mentioned it's relevant to also consider

 3 04:32:49   whether the contractor was progressing well on what he

 4 04:32:52   was spending time to work, so let's look at some of the

 5 04:32:55   project records.  Just to forgive you an orientation on

 6 04:32:59   the window as well, this is January 2022 to June 2022,

 7 04:33:02   so I'm going to pull up something in the middle.  This

 8 04:33:06   is exhibit C-481, it's a site meeting, minute number 19

 9 04:33:12   dated 12 April 2022.  I'm going to zoom in on page 189.

10 04:33:24       You will see this is a site meeting between all

11 04:33:26   parties in the project, and if we scroll down to item

12 04:33:29   4.5, you will see:

13 04:33:40       "The SR noted the significant progress of the works

14 04:33:43   attained in the past month that is the best since

15 04:33:45   commencement."

16 04:33:48       So the SR's contemporaneous record of Strabag's good

17 04:33:50   progress in that month illustrates that any delays to

18 04:33:54   the project at this point in time would not have been

19 04:33:56   slow progress; would you agree?

20 04:34:00.  I would disagree because from a critical path

21 04:34:02   perspective, this statement of SR, I cannot take it into

22 04:34:08   consideration, from a critical path perspective.

23 04:34:11       I do agree, if you see my graph, that the progress

24 04:34:15   of section 4 is good in this window, but the progress of

25 04:34:21   section 5, which should have started much earlier, is


                                     197






 1 04:34:25   bad in this window, and it has only started with

 2 04:34:29   a delay -- it has started with a delay of almost

 3 04:34:32   four months, and there also the progress is bad, and

 4 04:34:35   from a critical path perspective, section 5 becomes

 5 04:34:38   critical.  But yes, there is good progress on section 4.

 6 04:34:46.  No, Mr Singhal, would you agree that irrespective of

 7 04:34:51   whatever method of delay analysis we choose, the

 8 04:34:55   objective should be to identify causes of delay that

 9 04:35:01   align with the reality of the project?

10 04:35:04.  Yes.

11 04:35:07.  So in this case, where the SR and project parties were

12 04:35:12   recognising that Strabag was making good progress during

13 04:35:18   this point of the project, would you agree it

14 04:35:21   contradicts the conclusion derived out of your delay

15 04:35:25   analysis that it would have been slow progress on the

16 04:35:27   part of Strabag that caused delays?

17 04:35:31.  No, because my assessment is on the critical delays.

18 04:35:34   I do agree that a significant progress is being achieved

19 04:35:37   on section 4, but the section 5, which should also have

20 04:35:43   achieved the progress, as I have just explained, is

21 04:35:45   seeing very poor progress and therefore section 5 is

22 04:35:48   critical, and accordingly the critical delay has been

23 04:35:52   assigned.

24 04:35:53.  Mr Singhal, put it another way.  If the conclusion from

25 04:35:57   the delay analysis conflicts with the contemporaneous


                                     198






 1 04:36:04   recording of what might be a cause of delay, is your

 2 04:36:08   view that the conclusions from the delay analysis should

 3 04:36:11   prevail?

 4 04:36:13.  No, there is no contradiction between this point 4.5 and

 5 04:36:21   my analysis.  My analysis also shows significant project

 6 04:36:25   progress being achieved on section 4, but the critical

 7 04:36:28   delay therein, there is a very -- like a less progress

 8 04:36:33   or a critical progress being achieved on section 5 is

 9 04:36:36   driving the critical path.  So there is no

10 04:36:40   contradiction.

11 04:36:41.  Okay.  You mention whether there's contradiction between

12 04:36:46   your assessment of critical path and your own analysis,

13 04:36:49   so let's look at that as well.  Let's jump forward again

14 04:36:53   to another window, now window 5b.  This is at

15 04:36:56   paragraph 344 of RSD-2, your second delay report.

16 04:37:25       Are you there, Mr Singhal?

17 04:37:27.  Yes, please.

18 04:37:29.  So again to quickly orientate your assessment in this

19 04:37:33   window, you see sections 6 and 7 being progressed,

20 04:37:37   that's in the beige and the black lines.  Section 5 is

21 04:37:41   relatively stagnant.  Your conclusion of this window is

22 04:37:45   that section 5 is critical because of diversion of

23 04:37:49   resources from section 5 to section 6.  Is that correct?

24 04:37:55.  Because you can see, amongst the three sections which

25 04:37:57   are going on, section 5 is completely stagnant, no work


                                     199






 1 04:38:01   is taking place, and therefore it is driving the

 2 04:38:07   critical path.

 3 04:38:08.  So, Mr Singhal, you said earlier as well that one needs

 4 04:38:12   to consider the productivity of the efforts being

 5 04:38:17   deployed in particular sections.  So I want to show you

 6 04:38:22   another assessment that you carried out in RSD-2-01, we

 7 04:38:27   looked at this earlier as well, at 10G7, and this is

 8 04:38:33   appendix to your second report.

 9 04:38:38       Now if we cast our eye forward to this window 5b,

10 04:38:43   I think again I'll just mark the simple box to help

11 04:38:46   everyone focus their eyes.  This window is from December

12 04:38:50   2022 to 5 February 2023.

13 04:39:10.  Yes.

14 04:39:10.  In all these months, you assess that Strabag achieved

15 04:39:13   production rates that exceeded 812 cubic metres per day;

16 04:39:18   is that correct?

17 04:39:19.  Correct.

18 04:39:20.  In fact, in all three months your assessment is that

19 04:39:23   Strabag achieved production rates that even exceeded the

20 04:39:30   production rate which you believed should be used, which

21 04:39:32   is 1,473; is that correct?

22 04:39:36.  Correct.

23 04:39:37.  So where Strabag was carrying out additional G7

24 04:39:39   quantities on this window and on your own assessment was

25 04:39:42   exceeding production rates, the logical conclusion is


                                     200






 1 04:39:46   that the cause of delay in this window is the additional

 2 04:39:48   works and not slow progress; would you agree?

 3 04:39:58.  No, and I'll explain.  So if you go to the graphs, which

 4 04:40:04   is the graphs which you had referred earlier and is on

 5 04:40:08   my slide number 8 --

 6 04:40:09.  Let me pull it up for the tribunal as well.  RSD-2, your

 7 04:40:18   second report, paragraph 344 for the record.

 8 04:40:23.  Correct.

 9 04:40:23       Now let's look at all the three section.  Before

10 04:40:26   I go over there, just for the benefit of the tribunal,

11 04:40:30   these bars, the straight lines which were there -- can

12 04:40:36   you go back to the previous reference which was shown to

13 04:40:39   me --

14 04:40:39R SIM:  You want the Excel document?

15 04:40:39.  Yes.

16 04:40:39       These bars are for the consolidated G7 done in each

17 04:41:01   month, which means section -- three sections are

18 04:41:05   ongoing -- sorry, two sections are ongoing and one

19 04:41:08   section is stagnant, section 6 and section 7, so these

20 04:41:12   bars are the G7 done in both the sections 6 and 7

21 04:41:16   divided by, you know, the duration, and that's how the

22 04:41:20   productivity is there.

23 04:41:21       But from a critical path perspective, now let's go

24 04:41:24   to the graphs.  So if you can go back to the graphs?

25 04:41:36R SIM:  Just to confirm, this is paragraph 344?


                                     201






 1 04:41:39.  Correct.

 2 04:41:39       If you see in this graph what is happening is the

 3 04:41:54   black-coloured line is section 7, blue-coloured line is

 4 04:41:59   section 5, so there is almost stagnant progress in

 5 04:42:04   section 5.  The black colour is in section 7 so the work

 6 04:42:07   has started kind of thing, in start of the window also,

 7 04:42:10   and has started progressing and is now 60%, so less than

 8 04:42:16   the original planned quantity.  Section 6 has moved from

 9 04:42:21   80% all the way to 120%.

10 04:42:24       Now, three sections are going on, out of which one

11 04:42:27   is stagnant, one is doing good, which is section 6, and

12 04:42:31   one, section 7, is also not doing good because the slope

13 04:42:36   of section 7 is not as steep as the planned slope of

14 04:42:42   black coloured dotted line, which means that the

15 04:42:44   production of section 7 is lower than planned, section 5

16 04:42:49   is completely stalled, and section 6 is progressing.

17 04:42:55       Now, it will be incorrect for us to use those

18 04:42:57   vertical bars which you have just shown on the Excel

19 04:43:00   sheet to say that the critical delay is not there.

20 04:43:05   Overhead, three sections are ongoing.  The least

21 04:43:08   progress is being achieved on that stagnant section,

22 04:43:11   which is section 5, because of the leapfrogging from

23 04:43:13   section 4 all the way till section 6, and hence there is

24 04:43:16   a critical delay.

25 04:43:18R CHAN:  Mr Singhal, let me understand your evidence.  You


                                     202






 1 04:43:22   are saying that Strabag -- your expectation is for

 2 04:43:25   Strabag to meet the per-day production rate in each and

 3 04:43:29   every section?  Is that your evidence?

 4 04:43:40.  So my evidence is that if, by stopping one section

 5 04:43:46   completely, slowing down another section drastically and

 6 04:43:52   then increasing the productivity of one section, the

 7 04:43:55   slowest section is causing the critical delay, and

 8 04:44:00   that's the way how critical delay is calculated.

 9 04:44:03       What you are saying is, on a global basis,

10 04:44:06   considering all the three sections, globally if the

11 04:44:09   production is more than the production which is 812 or

12 04:44:14   1,423, therefore on a global basis there is no critical

13 04:44:17   delay, which is what Mr Cookson has also done.  In my

14 04:44:22   view that's not right, because the criticality is driven

15 04:44:26   by the slowest section which is ongoing, whose

16 04:44:29   production is the slowest and least.

17 04:44:34.  Let's take a step back.  This window 5b is a window

18 04:44:41   duration of 67 days.  Do you recall?

19 04:44:44.  Correct.

20 04:44:45.  And your assessed critical delay in this window is

21 04:44:48   67 days of critical delay.

22 04:44:50.  Yes, because section 5 is stagnant, completely stagnant,

23 04:44:53   you can see, and that's the reason why there is

24 04:44:56   a day-to-day critical delay taking place.

25 04:44:59.  On the other graph that we have just shown you, you


                                     203






 1 04:45:02   accept that the per-day production on average for G7

 2 04:45:08   exceeds 1,473 cubic metres per day in all these months?

 3 04:45:15.  Yes, because section 6, if you can see, the slope in

 4 04:45:18   section 6 is faster than the planned slope in the

 5 04:45:23   graphs.  Can you go back to the graphs?  And section 7,

 6 04:45:28   which has also been added in your calculations for that

 7 04:45:32   productivity level, has started moving in, so therefore

 8 04:45:35   the bar is showing more, but there is one section where

 9 04:45:39   the work is completely stagnant, which is what is

10 04:45:43   driving the critical path.

11 04:45:46.  So whilst you accept that Strabag exceeded a production

12 04:45:51   rate of 1,473 cubic metres per day through the entire

13 04:45:56   duration, your conclusion is that they had delayed the

14 04:46:02   entire 67-day window by 67 days of delay because they

15 04:46:09   did not produce additional quantities?

16 04:46:13.  No.  So my assessment is section 5 becoming completely

17 04:46:20   stagnant is the one driving the critical path.  On

18 04:46:24   a simplistic basis, if three things have to be done

19 04:46:28   together, two things are done very fast but the third

20 04:46:34   thing is completely not progressing, all three have to

21 04:46:37   be completed to finish the project, the third slowest

22 04:46:40   thing is going to drive the critical path.  That's the

23 04:46:43   basic concept of critical path.

24 04:46:48.  Mr Singhal, quite simply this sectional approach that

25 04:46:51   you have to select one particular critical section


                                     204






 1 04:47:00   ignores additional work that was being performed by

 2 04:47:03   Strabag, isn't it?

 3 04:47:04.  No.  If you will see, my windows 6, 7 and 8, there are

 4 04:47:10   extra times which critical delays which have been

 5 04:47:13   assigned by me because of the additional quantities.  So

 6 04:47:15   it's not that what you are saying is it's in this

 7 04:47:18   specific window, which is window 5b, because one section

 8 04:47:21   is completely stopped, which is section 5, and

 9 04:47:24   leapfrogged, that's the reason this drives the critical

10 04:47:28   path inside window 5b?

11 04:47:30.  We are perfectly aligned, I think both experts are

12 04:47:34   perfectly aligned that windows 6, 7 and 8 additional

13 04:47:37   quantities was driving delay and what I was trying to

14 04:47:41   understand was how you arrived at the view of window 3b

15 04:47:44   to 5b, a significant period, there were no additional

16 04:47:44   quantities, so that was all my questions.

17 04:47:48       But we've gone through three windows.  I'm just

18 04:47:51   going to sum up the position I put to you and you can

19 04:47:53   agree or disagree.

20 04:47:54       We've looked at three windows now, and in all

21 04:47:57   windows, Strabag was delivering quantities beyond the

22 04:48:00   additional quantities, and yet you have not identified

23 04:48:03   in any other windows the additional quantities as

24 04:48:07   a cause of delay.  So I put to you again that your

25 04:48:11   sectional approach to delay analysis ignores the


                                     205






 1 04:48:15   additional quantities performed by Strabag.  You can

 2 04:48:17   agree or disagree.

 3 04:48:22.  I disagree, and I believe the statement which you are

 4 04:48:25   putting to me is a global approach and not aligned to

 5 04:48:28   the concepts of critical path analysis.

 6 04:48:30.  Let's move on to another topic that your report

 7 04:48:35   expresses some views on, and this is the ATR design

 8 04:48:40   details.  I'm going to pull up your second delay report,

 9 04:48:45   RSD-2, paragraph 29.  My apologies.  Paragraph 611.13.

10 04:49:05   Just let you have a quick look at it, Mr Singhal.

11 04:49:11   (Pause)

12 04:49:34       Have you read the paragraph, Mr Singhal?

13 04:49:36.  Yes.

14 04:49:36.  As you can see, your position is that the ATR works had

15 04:49:39   been instructed in June 2021 and that the drawings

16 04:49:43   provided included a design for road markings.  Did you

17 04:49:48   review the 23 June 2021 letter and the design drawings

18 04:49:53   provided by the SR in the letter?

19 04:49:55.  Yes.

20 04:49:56.  Let's look at the letter then.  This is exhibit C-167.

21 04:50:07   It's the SR's 23 June 2021 letter.  If you see the first

22 04:50:17   paragraph, Mr Singhal, have a quick view of the first

23 04:50:22   paragraph.  Will you agree that the drawings provided on

24 04:50:26   23 June 2021 were provisional and not yet approved by

25 04:50:30   the supervisor?


                                     206






 1 04:50:34.  Yes, correct.

 2 04:50:35.  Okay.  Let's look at the drawings, and I'm going to go

 3 04:50:39   to page 10 as an example.  I think that would be

 4 04:50:49   helpful, and what I would like to sort of explore is

 5 04:50:53   a comparison of the June 2021 drawings that were

 6 04:50:56   provided and the eventual design in the 31 October 2024

 7 04:51:03   drawings.

 8 04:51:03       I'll pull up the 31 October 2024 drawings as well,

 9 04:51:07   and this is exhibit C-348 and the corresponding section

10 04:51:15   to the earlier drawing is at page 12 for the record.

11 04:51:20   I will try and pull this up side by side so we can do

12 04:51:23   a comparison.

13 04:51:42       Mr Singhal, can you see the two drawings displayed

14 04:51:47   on your screen?  There's the one up top, top left, is

15 04:51:50   the June 2021 drawing, and the one below is the

16 04:51:56   31 October 2024 drawings.  So I have a couple of

17 04:51:59   questions arising from these June 2021 drawings that you

18 04:52:03   mentioned and confirmed you have reviewed, Mr Singhal.

19 04:52:10.  So I will need -- if you go to my report,

20 04:52:13   paragraph 611.13, which you had taken me to --

21 04:52:18.  Yes?

22 04:52:18.  -- on the next page, there are some drawings which are

23 04:52:20   mentioned.

24 04:52:27.  I will just finish this exercise and then let's see --

25 04:52:29.  No, because this is important because there it is


                                     207






 1 04:52:31   a standard drawing for road marking detail, so is this

 2 04:52:35   drawing which you are showing me --

 3 04:52:37.  We'll come to that.  We'll come to that.

 4 04:52:42.  In order to answer this, I will need to see this

 5 04:52:44   particular drawing, road marking drawing, which is item

 6 04:52:53   number 17 on page number 222.

 7 04:53:00.  Let me just get you the reference?

 8 04:53:01.  The reference is C-167, the same reference.

 9 04:53:05.  Page 19?  I think the drawing you are referring to is

10 04:53:08   page 19?

11 04:53:09.  The drawing I'm referring to is the serial number 17.

12 04:53:13   If you can show me --

13 04:53:14.  I just have a quick question on C-167 before we pull up

14 04:53:18   the design drawing.  A very quick question.  On C-167,

15 04:53:22   the June 2021 drawings, has a design for the Magni

16 04:53:27   roundabout been provided?

17 04:53:34.  Okay.  The paragraph which you're taking me is for ATR

18 04:53:43   road marking, but the question which you are asking me

19 04:53:46   is for Magni Road design, so there is a conflict between

20 04:53:50   the para reference which you are taking me to and the

21 04:53:53   question which you are putting me to.

22 04:53:55.  Mr Singhal, you considered the progress of the Magni

23 04:53:57   roundabout in your report; is that correct?

24 04:54:00.  No, because for me, ATR roads are not critical.  So this

25 04:54:05   particular paragraph 611.13 is with respect to the road


                                     208






 1 04:54:08   marking where Mr Cookson has considered the road

 2 04:54:11   markings to be critical in window 10.  But Magni

 3 04:54:15   roundabout, these are not critical and I have not done

 4 04:54:20   the -- you know, for me it does not affect my analysis.

 5 04:54:25.  So, Mr Singhal, you are saying you are not aware that in

 6 04:54:30   2024, in the later stages of the project, the Magni Road

 7 04:54:34   was redesigned to include a roundabout?

 8 04:54:37.  It is of no relevance to me because it's not on the

 9 04:54:40   critical path as per my analysis.

10 04:54:42.  So you are not aware?

11 04:54:44.  No, I don't remember.  I'm being aware or not is not the

12 04:54:48   question.  The issue is it's not relevant to my

13 04:54:50   analysis.  And the para which you are taking me, 611.13:

14 04:54:56   specifically for ATR road markings and not for Magni

15 04:55:00   roundabout.

16 04:55:01.  I'm just trying to show you what was provided in June

17 04:55:04   2021 and a document that's on the record, the October

18 04:55:08   2024 final design drawings for the ATRs.  So this is a

19 04:55:14   document on the record and I just wanted to get your

20 04:55:17   professional view when we compare these two documents.

21 04:55:23   I will show you the general scheme that you refer to as

22 04:55:26   well, but just staying first on C-167, the June 2021

23 04:55:31   drawings, you confirm you have reviewed this document?

24 04:55:33.  Yes.

25 04:55:34.  So my question is: for the Magni Road indicated on this


                                     209






 1 04:55:38   page, was a roundabout designed in these drawings?

 2 04:55:44.  In C-167, the Magni roundabout details which you are

 3 04:55:48   showing to me -- of course I'll have to see the other

 4 04:55:51   documents which I have not seen -- but what is shown to

 5 04:55:53   me, C-167 vis--vis what is shown to me at the bottom of

 6 04:55:56   the screen, the bottom of the screen has more details

 7 04:56:00   and dimensions as compared to the C-167.

 8 04:56:04       But, as I said, it's not relevant to my analysis.

 9 04:56:15.  Let's look at the general scheme drawing that you wanted

10 04:56:19   to look at then, that you asked to look at that

11 04:56:21   document.  That's page 19, if I recall correctly, of

12 04:56:25   C-167.  Is this the drawing?

13 04:56:52.  Correct.  Because para reference 611.13, which you took

14 04:56:56   me to, talks about the ATR road marking related issue,

15 04:57:00   and this particular issue was the details were given,

16 04:57:04   the standard details were given on 23 June 2021 for the

17 04:57:09   road ATR road marking, which Mr Cookson says has been

18 04:57:13   given -- has not been given or has been given very late.

19 04:57:17.  So your evidence, Mr Singhal, is true provision of this

20 04:57:22   drawing that we see at page 19 of C-167, the detailed

21 04:57:27   design for ATR road markings has been provided to

22 04:57:30   Strabag?  Is that your evidence?

23 04:57:32.  Correct, because after that, there is no further

24 04:57:34   drawings which have been provided by the respondent and

25 04:57:37   the claimant has finally made his execution drawing


                                     210






 1 04:57:41   based on the standard drawings only, and in my view,

 2 04:57:43   generally for road markings, these are the standard

 3 04:57:46   drawings which are provided.

 4 04:57:49.  Mr Singhal, does this design scheme provide any road

 5 04:57:52   markings for a roundabout?

 6 04:57:55.  No, because if -- the scheme is generally applicable for

 7 04:57:59   the road markings, and very much applicable for the

 8 04:58:03   roundabouts also.

 9 04:58:06.  My question is very specific.  So is your evidence that

10 04:58:10   this design scheme provides a road marking for

11 04:58:12   a roundabout?

12 04:58:13.  Yes, this is the standard detail for road markings.  Can

13 04:58:18   you go down?  It's written over there at the bottom.  Go

14 04:58:21   down.  This is road marking details, and this is the

15 04:58:26   standard drawing, and this is the drawing which is --

16 04:58:28   can be used to do the road markings for both roundabout

17 04:58:32   and the straight-line roads.

18 04:58:34.  I'm going to go back to C-348, and you have a quick

19 04:58:55   look.  So this is the eventual roundabout and the road

20 04:59:01   markings designed at the Magni Road.

21 04:59:03.  Correct.

22 04:59:10.  So my question to you is: in your professional view, you

23 04:59:13   consider that the design scheme provided in the June

24 04:59:15   2021 drawings would enable Strabag to know what road

25 04:59:22   marking design was required for the Magni roundabout?


                                     211






 1 04:59:25.  Yes, because that's the way how road markings execution

 2 04:59:28   is done.  There is a standard drawing.  And factually

 3 04:59:30   also, there was no other drawing provided by respondent,

 4 04:59:34   but ultimately Magni roundabout ATR markings were done,

 5 04:59:36   road markings were done, and the execution drawings for

 6 04:59:41   Magni roundabout were developed by Strabag.

 7 04:59:45.  Shall we go back to C-167.  Last question on this

 8 05:00:07   drawing, Mr Singhal.  Does the June 2021 drawing provide

 9 05:00:11   a road marking scheme for a roundabout?

10 05:00:16.  Yes, this is the standard drawing for road marking,

11 05:00:17   which is suitable for straight line as well as

12 05:00:20   roundabout.  I just explained in my previous answer.

13 05:00:23   And that's the way how road mark execution is also done.

14 05:00:27.  Okay.  Staying on the topic of ATRs, you spoke to ATRs

15 05:00:36   at slide 19 of your delay presentation earlier today and

16 05:00:39   I'll pull that up.

17 05:01:01.  Slide number, I think is 16.

18 05:01:04.  Ah, 16.  You know your slides well, Mr Singhal.

19 05:01:07.  Thank you.

20 05:01:07.  So I wanted to explore bullet point 4 where you say:

21 05:01:14       "... there is no evidence in the extensive

22 05:01:16   correspondence between the Parties -- whether concerning

23 05:01:19   ATR or other matters -- that the Claimant ever raised

24 05:01:22   any concern or request indicating that the design

25 05:01:24   details for the ATR road markings were unavailable or


                                     212






 1 05:01:28   insufficient."

 2 05:01:29       So, Mr Singhal, you reviewed all the correspondence

 3 05:01:31   in relation to the ATRs that are in evidence?

 4 05:01:41.  Yes.

 5 05:01:41.  I'm going to pull up a letter, C-409.  This is Strabag's

 6 05:01:47   24 May 2023 letter, so this is after the June 2021

 7 05:01:55   drawings that we looked at.  You'll see it's addressed

 8 05:02:00   to Eptisa.  The subject title is:

 9 05:02:03       "Request for information -- outstanding design

10 05:02:05   information for Adjumani Town Roads."

11 05:02:10       If we scroll down, it says:

12 05:02:12       "We kindly request you to instruct the design

13 05:02:15   schedule for ... in Adjumani such as road marking, road

14 05:02:20   signs and road studs."

15 05:02:21       Would you agree that Strabag in its 24 May 2023

16 05:02:24   letter was requesting for outstanding design information

17 05:02:26   for the ATR road markings?

18 05:02:29.  Yes, in this particular letter, which is -- can you show

19 05:02:32   me the date? -- 24 May 2023.  The slide 16 you're

20 05:02:41   referring is the window 10 period, which is August 2024

21 05:02:44   to December 2024.  So we can't correlate the two of

22 05:02:49   them.  In this particular letter, yes, they have

23 05:02:51   written, "Give us the road marking details", and this is

24 05:02:57   2023, May.

25 05:02:57.  So you're correcting your statement in your delay


                                     213






 1 05:03:01   presentation to say that your view is that there's no

 2 05:03:04   request in window 10?

 3 05:03:07.  No.  Because if you see the top heading of my slide 16,

 4 05:03:12   it says:

 5 05:03:15       "Were the ATR road markings the only critical item

 6 05:03:18   in window 10?"

 7 05:03:20       So when I'm writing, this is with respect to

 8 05:03:23   window 10, and window 10 period is August 2024

 9 05:03:25   to December 2024.

10 05:03:30.  Very well.  One more question on this.

11 05:03:31       Mr Singhal, you accept that Strabag was asking for

12 05:03:35   design information in relation to road markings in May

13 05:03:39   2023.  So the fact that Strabag was asking for

14 05:03:42   outstanding design information for the ATR road markings

15 05:03:46   in 2023 confirms that the June 2021 drawings did not

16 05:03:50   contain the design for the ATR road markings.  Would you

17 05:03:54   agree?

18 05:03:54.  No, I would not agree, because ultimately no other

19 05:03:57   drawing for ATR road marking was provided by the

20 05:04:00   respondent, and Strabag executed the ATR road marking

21 05:04:04   using that same standard design, which was there in

22 05:04:06   June 2021.

23 05:04:11R CHAN:  Okay, thank you, Mr Singhal for your time and

24 05:04:13   patience.

25 05:04:14       Mr President and members of tribunal, I have no


                                     214






 1 05:04:17   further questions.

 2 05:04:18HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Is there any re-examination?

 3 05:04:23R ATWINE:  Yes, just a couple of questions.  Thank you very

 4 05:04:25   much.

 5 05:04:25               Re-examination by MR ATWINE

 6 05:04:28R ATWINE:  Mr Singhal, you were asked about whether you had

 7 05:04:31   performed the study to understand whether Strabag had

 8 05:04:36   sufficient resources.  I would like to take you to your

 9 05:04:44   report, RSD-2, paragraph 274.  Do you see that,

10 05:05:05   Mr Singhal?

11 05:05:11.  Correct.

12 05:05:15.  Are you able to interpret what that means?

13 05:05:18.  Yes, so as I explained, you know, at this stage there

14 05:05:22   were 11 excavators but none of them were deployed to

15 05:05:26   section 4.  And as I have explained in the

16 05:05:28   cross-examination also, section 2, section 3 were

17 05:05:31   completed, but section 4 was not started.

18 05:05:34.  Okay.  I would also like to take you to the joint

19 05:05:36   report 1, first joint report, paragraph 3.4.5.9.

20 05:05:48       Do you see that, Mr Singhal?

21 05:05:55.  Yes.

22 05:05:55.  What do you interpret from what you're reading?

23 05:06:00.  Here again I have explained about the allocation and the

24 05:06:03   utilisation of the resources with respect to section 4.

25 05:06:08.  Okay.  Now, you were shown a minutes of meeting of


                                     215






 1 05:06:13   a meeting held on 12 April 2022, and I assume this was

 2 05:06:19   before the start of section 5; am I correct?

 3 05:06:26.  Yes.

 4 05:06:28.  I would like to take you to exhibit RSD-38, which are

 5 05:06:33   minutes of meeting of 15 June 2022.  I would like to

 6 05:06:39   point you in particular to paragraph 15.2.  Can you read

 7 05:06:44   that paragraph, Mr Singhal?

 8 05:06:47.  "Slow progress along Adjumani Town kilometre 42+600 to

 9 05:06:56   46+200."

10 05:06:58       Which is the same section.  And there are multiple

11 05:06:59   other correspondences where the respondent are

12 05:06:59   requesting to fasten up the section 5 because this was

13 05:07:01   an important section close to the town, but it was

14 05:07:06   leapfrogged.

15 05:07:12.  Just so we can confirm, which section are we talking

16 05:07:14   about here?

17 05:07:15.  Section 5.

18 05:07:16.  Very good.

19 05:07:18       On the [draft] transcript at point 13.4 to 16.30 you

20 05:07:25   said Adjumani Town Roads was not the reason for delay,

21 05:07:33   the administrative order was with regard to section 4,

22 05:07:37   was not the reason for delay.  What exactly did you mean

23 05:07:40   by this, when you said the administrative order was not

24 05:07:44   the reason for the delay?

25 05:07:50.  I think this was with respect to section 4's


                                     216






 1 05:07:53   administrative order.

 2 05:07:54.  Yes.

 3 05:07:55.  Wherein the phase two, I think there is a correction,

 4 05:07:58   because when I said the administrative order, it was

 5 05:08:01   with respect to section 4 start.

 6 05:08:05.  Yes.  And you said that the administrative order was not

 7 05:08:08   the reason for the delay.

 8 05:08:12.  Because the administrative order came after the start of

 9 05:08:15   section 4.

10 05:08:17.  Okay.  Then in the beginning of your cross-examination,

11 05:08:22   you were asked a question about Table D and you were

12 05:08:28   shown the production rate for G7 grader, which is 4,200

13 05:08:33   and something?  And 50.  And you said there was an error

14 05:08:36   because the rate did not tally with that of the

15 05:08:39   operator.  You were asked whether this -- why this was

16 05:08:46   the first time you identified the -- do you remember

17 05:08:49   that?

18 05:08:49.  Yes.

19 05:08:50.  I would like to take you to your second report, RSD-2,

20 05:08:53   paragraph 130.  Okay?  Can you read that, Mr Singhal?

21 05:09:26.  Yes.

22 05:09:27.  Okay.  So this is where you first identified the error,

23 05:09:31   right?

24 05:09:31.  Yes.  And I actually did, during my cross-examination

25 05:09:35   also, that it was stated somewhere earlier as well.


                                     217






 1 05:09:39.  Okay.  And you said something, that if this discrepancy

 2 05:09:41   or error is corrected, what would be the implication?

 3 05:09:47.  I believe Strabag would not be the lowest bidder.

 4 05:09:54.  Okay.  Now, in respect to the Adjumani Town Roads, you

 5 05:09:59   were asked about the Magni Road roundabout, and you said

 6 05:10:11   the ATR road works were not relevant to your analysis of

 7 05:10:14   delay.  Can you please explain your basis for saying

 8 05:10:16   that?

 9 05:10:17.  Because the critical path for me is section 7 and not

10 05:10:21   the ATR, those provisional roads.

11 05:10:25.  Okay.  And then I would also like to show you this third

12 05:10:32   report by Mr Lee Cookson, CXS-5, paragraph 5.4.23.  Can

13 05:10:47   you read that paragraph, Mr Singhal, and tell us what

14 05:11:01   you understand.

15 05:11:04.  Yes, so the work was going on in August 2024, and as

16 05:11:13   I said, the August 2024 is my window number 6 and window

17 05:11:19   number 7, and I have not considered ATR as critical.

18 05:11:25.  Okay, thank you.

19 05:11:25       Now the last one.  When you were being

20 05:11:28   cross-examined on delay to the start of section 4, you

21 05:11:32   said in contemporaneous letters, you said something

22 05:11:35   about -- what was the reason for the delayed start of

23 05:11:39   section 4 according to the contemporaneous letters which

24 05:11:41   you were able to study?

25 05:11:46.  The administrative order.


                                     218






 1 05:11:49R ATWINE:  Thank you very much, Mr Singhal.  No more

 2 05:11:50   questions.

 3 05:11:52                Questions by THE TRIBUNAL

 4 05:11:55HE PRESIDENT:  Mr Singhal, I think the tribunal would like

 5 05:11:57   your help on the same issue as I dealt with with your

 6 05:11:59   fellow expert.  The tribunal hasn't reached a view on

 7 05:12:06   this, but it can understand that at least some of the

 8 05:12:08   questions in issue are: should the precise locations of

 9 05:12:17   the rock fill have been specified earlier?  And if they

10 05:12:20   had, would that have stopped some delay?  Or, putting it

11 05:12:26   conversely: was the fact that the particular locations

12 05:12:31   of the rock fill were not available on day one something

13 05:12:34   which caused delay?

14 05:12:36       If the tribunal were to conclude that the contractor

15 05:12:39   should have had the specified locations of rock fill on

16 05:12:42   day one, can we see anywhere in your analysis any

17 05:12:48   assistance for us to work out what delay the fact they

18 05:12:51   did not have that, the specified locations, caused them?

19 05:12:57.  No, sir.  So neither in my analysis nor Mr Cookson's

20 05:13:01   analysis.

21 05:13:02HE PRESIDENT:  Mr Cookson's analysis?

22 05:13:03.  Neither.  So in my analysis, you won't find that detail.

23 05:13:06       So what I understand from your question is that

24 05:13:14   there is a rock fill which is stated on X date, and as

25 05:13:21   a result of that rock fill, there is subsequent delays


                                     219






 1 05:13:25   which are taking place in G7 and all.

 2 05:13:29       Now, this hypothesis has several assumptions.

 3 05:13:32   Number one, that rock fill had an increased G7 quantity.

 4 05:13:41   It's not that every rock fill which is coming in the

 5 05:13:46   swampy area had a change of line and level.  So that is

 6 05:13:51   the very fundamental assumption that rock fill is

 7 05:13:54   followed by a change in the line and level.

 8 05:13:58HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  I hear you.  I'm not making that

 9 05:14:01   assumption for the purpose of my question.

10 05:14:02.  Yes.

11 05:14:05       And then the second thing is: if this swampy area or

12 05:14:10   where the rock fill would have been known to the

13 05:14:12   claimant earlier but it was known to the claimant

14 05:14:18   few days prior to reaching that position or maybe one

15 05:14:22   day prior to reaching that position, then ideally

16 05:14:27   I would have done a chainage-by-chainage analysis.

17 05:14:36       I would have done when was that particular chainage

18 05:14:39   rock fill instruction given, what was the status of the

19 05:14:42   G7 around that area, and what was the disruption, loss

20 05:14:50   of productivity, to that G7 equipments caused because of

21 05:14:55   a sudden instruction coming because of the presence of

22 05:14:58   rock fill.

23 05:15:01       Now, that analysis has not been done by me because

24 05:15:04   the records are not there to undertake such kind of

25 05:15:08   an analysis.


                                     220






 1 05:15:08HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  So I have a similar question in

 2 05:15:11   relation to line and level.  One of the points which the

 3 05:15:15   claimant made in its opening -- and we'll have to work

 4 05:15:18   out the facts of this, but let's assume the claimant is

 5 05:15:21   correct -- is that there were some significant changes

 6 05:15:24   to the design in terms of line and level of the roads

 7 05:15:30   quite separate to rock fill.  Are you with me?

 8 05:15:32.  Yes, sir.

 9 05:15:33HE PRESIDENT:  If the tribunal were to conclude that the

10 05:15:38   claimant was entitled to have the line and level design

11 05:15:42   completed on day one but there were changes after that

12 05:15:46   which changed so that the design was changed late, does

13 05:15:51   your report help us in understanding the delays which

14 05:15:53   have been caused by that?

15 05:15:57.  Yes, sir, because when I am doing my analysis

16 05:16:02   considering plan versus actual, and there are -- the

17 05:16:07   plans are -- let's say section 6 has got a date when the

18 05:16:14   section 6 has to start.  Now, when do you need those

19 05:16:18   drawings?  Two scenarios.  In the beginning of the

20 05:16:22   project, the drawings of section 6 have no relevance.

21 05:16:25   When you are planned to start section 6, do you have the

22 05:16:30   drawings or not?

23 05:16:32       Now, there is no such situation where the analysis

24 05:16:38   which has been done takes into consideration that

25 05:16:41   particular aspect, that there is a change in line and


                                     221






 1 05:16:45   levels because of which there is a change, which is

 2 05:16:49   where I have given days in windows 6, 7 and 8.

 3 05:16:54HE PRESIDENT:  I'm not sure I followed that.

 4 05:16:57       In your second report, tell me the paragraphs that

 5 05:17:01   the tribunal can look at or the sections the tribunal

 6 05:17:04   can look at to work out what delays, if any, were caused

 7 05:17:08   by the late change of design, if such a thing happened.

 8 05:17:17.  Yes, so if you go to my slides, my primary analysis and

 9 05:17:21   secondary analysis, both are taking into consideration

10 05:17:23   a change in the line and levels.  The reason why G7

11 05:17:26   quantities are increasing is because of change of line

12 05:17:28   and levels.  And when we are considering the planned

13 05:17:32   versus actual, the plan is already taking into

14 05:17:36   consideration the drawings' availability and there is no

15 05:17:40   deviation with respect to that plan and the drawings'

16 05:17:43   availability.

17 05:17:45       So the delay which is happening is: drawings came,

18 05:17:50   drawings changed the line and levels.  So both the

19 05:17:55   experts do not say it is the delay in the design.

20 05:17:58       The reason for delay, which is right now under

21 05:18:01   dispute between the two experts, is: line and levels

22 05:18:04   have changed.  So, whether line and level changed has

23 05:18:07   caused delay or not has caused delay.  The experts are

24 05:18:10   not saying because of the delaying the issuance of the

25 05:18:13   drawings, there is an issue of critical path or critical


                                     222






 1 05:18:16   delay.

 2 05:18:17HE PRESIDENT:  But they are trying -- you're saying that

 3 05:18:20   the experts are modelling the effect of the change when

 4 05:18:23   it comes?

 5 05:18:25.  Correct.

 6 05:18:26HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Last question for you.

 7 05:18:35       It might be said that if you're trying to work out

 8 05:18:41   why delays have occurred, you need to look at what the

 9 05:18:45   contractor was planning to do in each of your windows.

10 05:18:51   You're nodding, just for the transcript.

11 05:18:53.  Yes, sir.

12 05:18:54HE PRESIDENT:  Why is it not relevant that at a certain

13 05:18:56   point the contractor got extensions of time and

14 05:18:59   therefore his plans would have taken into account the

15 05:19:02   extensions of time he had been given?  Why would that

16 05:19:05   not affect how he allocates his resources, where he sees

17 05:19:09   the critical path and what works he has to do?

18 05:19:11.  So, sir, in that situation, ideally what should have

19 05:19:14   happened is when an extension of time is granted,

20 05:19:18   a revised baseline or a revised plan is prepared, which

21 05:19:21   is then agreed between the parties, and that plan

22 05:19:25   becomes the plan after the extension of time has been

23 05:19:28   granted.

24 05:19:29HE PRESIDENT:  I understand that's the ideal.  But just

25 05:19:31   address my question, if you will, Mr Singhal, which is:


                                     223






 1 05:19:36   okay, that ideal didn't happen, but why would one not at

 2 05:19:40   least take into account that such extensions of time had

 3 05:19:43   been given, particularly given your analysis suggests

 4 05:19:46   that the contractor was working on non-critical

 5 05:19:49   activities?

 6 05:19:51.  So, sir, my analysis of the critical path takes into

 7 05:19:55   consideration what is happening in actual, because I am

 8 05:19:58   drawing an as-built actual critical path.  So depending

 9 05:20:03   upon if, hypothetically or in actual, contractor has

10 05:20:06   taken into consideration an extension of time, and

11 05:20:09   accordingly working, I am basing my critical path based

12 05:20:12   on the actuals and then comparing it with the baseline.

13 05:20:16       Now, if that ideal situation would have existed that

14 05:20:19   because of the EOT the baseline would have changed, then

15 05:20:22   my magnitude calculations would have been different.

16 05:20:25       So today in front of the tribunal, I am giving you

17 05:20:28   my magnitude based on the original one single baseline

18 05:20:31   agreed between the parties, but my as-built critical

19 05:20:33   path is based on what is happening in actual,

20 05:20:37   considering a potential scenario that the contractor, in

21 05:20:40   his mind, is working taking into consideration the EOT.

22 05:20:43HE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but isn't the problem there that the

23 05:20:47   contractor may well have changed how he planned to

24 05:20:51   complete the works if he's given an extension of time?

25 05:20:56   And so you're comparing what he did against the original


                                     224






 1 05:20:59   plan, when one might expect a contractor to alter a plan

 2 05:21:03   if they're given an extension of time.

 3 05:21:05.  True, sir.  So you --

 4 05:21:07HE PRESIDENT:  Isn't that a problem with your analysis?

 5 05:21:09.  No, sir, because if there would have been a revised

 6 05:21:13   baseline plan, my magnitude of delays would have

 7 05:21:18   probably changed.  Here, the issue in front of the

 8 05:21:21   tribunal is not the extension of time, to that extent;

 9 05:21:25   it is the compensation of the time.  Now, in that

10 05:21:30   perspective --

11 05:21:31HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  I don't follow that because what your

12 05:21:34   analysis is seeking to do is to assist us with the

13 05:21:36   question of: what the extent of delays are and what has

14 05:21:41   caused it.

15 05:21:43.  Correct.

16 05:21:44HE PRESIDENT:  I don't understand why one of the potential

17 05:21:47   causes of how the works happened being the contractor

18 05:21:51   replanning once it gets an extension of time is not

19 05:21:54   relevant to that analysis.

20 05:21:59.  So, sir, it is relevant to the analysis.  That's why

21 05:22:01   actuals is based on what is happening on real ground,

22 05:22:04   taking into consideration the EOTs.

23 05:22:10       The only problem is that if we do not have the

24 05:22:12   revised baseline, contemporaneous document, how do

25 05:22:17   I then measure the delay against that so-called revised


                                     225






 1 05:22:22   baseline after the EOT?  There is no such thing.

 2 05:22:25HE PRESIDENT:  Can I help?  Can I ask a point of detail

 3 05:22:28   then.  I probably should know this.  Your baseline that

 4 05:22:31   you have used and your fellow expert has used is rev 0

 5 05:22:35   or rev 3?

 6 05:22:37.  Rev 0.

 7 05:22:38.  Does rev 3 not change the programming or is it the same

 8 05:22:42   programme that's used?

 9 05:22:43.  No, sir, rev 3 changes the analysis, but rev 3 is not

10 05:22:47   an agreed programme between the parties.  And rev 3

11 05:22:52   also, I think, do not precisely tie up with the

12 05:22:55   extension of time because there is a dispute on the

13 05:22:57   extension of time itself.

14 05:22:59HE PRESIDENT:  But if I looked at rev 3, would I find the

15 05:23:01   contractor putting forward and then working to

16 05:23:03   a different programme than rev 0?

17 05:23:06.  So rev 3 is definitely different from rev 0.

18 05:23:10HE PRESIDENT:  Why?  And this may be a question I could

19 05:23:12   have asked Mr Cookson, because he uses rev 0 as well,

20 05:23:16   doesn't he?

21 05:23:17.  No, he uses rev 0 and then he subsequently uses rev 3 to

22 05:23:21   calculate his magnitude.

23 05:23:23HE PRESIDENT:  Why isn't he more right than you on that, if

24 05:23:27   rev 3 reflects the contractor's replanning, having

25 05:23:32   received an extension of time?


                                     226






 1 05:23:34.  Precisely, sir.  Had the rev 3 replanning been as per

 2 05:23:38   the extension of time granted, precisely -- so the issue

 3 05:23:41   over here is also the dispute on the extension of time,

 4 05:23:43   whether the EOT which has been granted is right EOT or

 5 05:23:47   not.  But if the rev 3 is precisely matching with the

 6 05:23:51   extension of time, then in that case -- and it is agreed

 7 05:23:54   between the parties -- then I would expect.

 8 05:23:56       Now, two presumptions.  If it is not agreed between

 9 05:23:58   the parties but the rev 3 is as per the extension of

10 05:24:01   time given by the supervisor, then of course somebody

11 05:24:05   can say that rev 3 should be the right programme.

12 05:24:10       But, still, the agreed position between the parties

13 05:24:11   is neither rev 3 nor rev 3 precisely compares with the

14 05:24:15   extension of time because it does not compare and

15 05:24:19   neither the extension of time is agreed between the

16 05:24:21   parties.

17 05:24:22HE PRESIDENT:  Does it roughly compare?  To your

18 05:24:25   professional eye, does it reflect at least to some

19 05:24:29   extent the extensions of time that were given up to that

20 05:24:30   point?  I can go and check this myself, but --

21 05:24:36.  Sir, I have not precisely seen it that whether rev 3 is

22 05:24:40   exactly as per the EOT granted, but if tribunal says,

23 05:24:44   I can check this and come back.

24 05:24:46HE PRESIDENT:  I don't want to beat this to death, but

25 05:24:49   I don't understand why, if you are seeking to compare


                                     227






 1 05:24:51   the contractor's actual progress against the

 2 05:24:53   contractor's planned progress, why rev 3 has to be

 3 05:24:57   an agreed programme for you to use it.  Doesn't it just

 4 05:25:02   have to be the programme the contractor was working to,

 5 05:25:05   in the same way that an updated monthly progress

 6 05:25:09   programme doesn't have to be agreed and you still use

 7 05:25:12   it?

 8 05:25:15.  Sir, I am doing an as-planned/as-built.  As-planned is

 9 05:25:19   the baseline programme which should be agreed between

10 05:25:22   the parties.  Let's assume contractor comes and prepares

11 05:25:26   a completely hypothetical programme which shows that the

12 05:25:28   project is going to be delayed by 20 years --

13 05:25:30HE PRESIDENT:  But I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking

14 05:25:33   about a programme which I think you're telling me the

15 05:25:35   contractor was working to after extensions of time were

16 05:25:37   given but was not agreed between the parties.

17 05:25:39.  No, no, sir.  I'm not saying that the contractor was

18 05:25:42   working to rev 3.  What I am saying is whether rev 3 has

19 05:25:46   to be considered as the baseline programme in this

20 05:25:49   analysis or not.

21 05:25:51       Now, there are two answers to that -- three answers

22 05:25:53   to that.

23 05:25:54       Number one, rev 3 of course is not agreed, but let's

24 05:25:58   keep that aside.

25 05:25:58       Number two, is rev 3 precisely as per the EOT


                                     228






 1 05:26:02   granted by one of the parties?  That's number two, but

 2 05:26:05   I have not done that, and I believe that it is not in

 3 05:26:10   complete compliance to the extension of time.

 4 05:26:12       Number three, sir, the dispute over here is more

 5 05:26:18   from a compensation perspective.  Now, let's assume

 6 05:26:22   I would have used rev 3.  My magnitudes would have been

 7 05:26:27   different.  Now, in that situation, my magnitudes would

 8 05:26:32   have probably reduced as compared to the original

 9 05:26:35   baseline because rev 3 is changing the durations.  So

10 05:26:37   then, in that case, an analysis done using rev 3 will

11 05:26:41   probably give you an incorrect results from

12 05:26:43   a compensation point of view.

13 05:26:45HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  I've probably taken up too much time

14 05:26:49   on that.

15 05:26:50       Have you any questions?

16 05:26:53       Can I ask, is there any further cross-examination

17 05:26:56   arising from those questions of mine.

18 05:27:02R GILLION:  Maybe a quick question.

19 05:27:03             Cross-examination by MR GILLION

20 05:27:05R GILLION:  Mr Singhal, would your opinion have changed if

21 05:27:07   the rev 3 programme had been approved or deemed

22 05:27:11   approved?

23 05:27:12.  The issue is of deemed approval and had been approved.

24 05:27:15   If rev 3 programme would have been approved and

25 05:27:18   considered as the revised baseline, then in that case


                                     229






 1 05:27:21   I would have done the magnitude of calculations from

 2 05:27:24   rev 3, but that would have been going wrong in favour of

 3 05:27:27   the claimant, who is seeking a compensation, because the

 4 05:27:30   value of the compensation will reduce.

 5 05:27:34.  Do you remember the date of the rev 3 programme?

 6 05:27:37.  I don't remember precisely.  I think it was August 2021

 7 05:27:39   or so.

 8 05:27:40.  Absolutely.  Do you recall when the EOT granted in

 9 05:27:45   respect of these additional quantities was issued to

10 05:27:49   Strabag?

11 05:27:51.  I don't remember.  If you can just remind me?

12 05:27:54.  AO5, which was in 2022.  November 2022.AO5

13 05:28:05       Did you expect then the re-baselines had been done

14 05:28:09   at that date, at a time when all the -- most additional

15 05:28:12   quantities would have been performed, would it make

16 05:28:14   sense to rely on the contemporaneous revised programme

17 05:28:17   submitted by Strabag in August 2021?

18 05:28:19.  No.  Then in that case the rev 3 is not applicable

19 05:28:22   because if the EOT is granted in November 2022 and the

20 05:28:25   rev 3 is coming in August 2021, then rev 3 is not in

21 05:28:29   compliance with the EOT.

22 05:28:32.  You're essentially saying that the more time the

23 05:28:35   supervisor takes to determine an EOT, the better,

24 05:28:38   because you can't rely on the revised programme that was

25 05:28:43   contemporaneously issued by the contractor?


                                     230






 1 05:28:45.  No, so I'm not saying that.  What I am saying is that is

 2 05:28:50   the rev 3 programme the right programme, taking into

 3 05:28:53   consideration the EOT?  And that answers tribunal

 4 05:28:57   question also.  If rev 3 is coming in 2021, EOT is

 5 05:29:00   granted in 2022, then of course rev 3 is not the right

 6 05:29:03   programme.  And also, had I done my analysis using rev 3

 7 05:29:05   and accordingly calculated the magnitudes, my magnitudes

 8 05:29:10   would have reduced, and that would have reduced the

 9 05:29:12   overall critical delay from a point of view of

10 05:29:15   compensation.  So because rev 1, let's assume, says

11 05:29:21   section 1 to be completed in, hypothetically January

12 05:29:26   2021, rev 3 would say it's going to be completed

13 05:29:29   probably in late 2021.  So what will happen?  Magnitudes

14 05:29:33   will change.

15 05:29:33.  Would you say that this rev 3 programme, which was

16 05:29:36   issued in August 2021 after the contractor realised the

17 05:29:40   extent and impact of these additional quantities, which

18 05:29:43   we agreed happened on this project, must be a relevant

19 05:29:49   consideration for an expert when assessing the true

20 05:29:52   impact of these quantities on the progress?

21 05:29:54.  No, I would not say that rev 3, which is not approved as

22 05:29:57   a baseline programme agreed between the parties, should

23 05:30:00   be considered as an assessment because that will

24 05:30:02   probably give incorrect results against the claimant.

25 05:30:07.  It's obviously a legal question, but has the Attorney


                                     231






 1 05:30:11   General's team ever mentioned to you that the rev 3

 2 05:30:14   programme may be considered deemed approved?

 3 05:30:18.  No, I have not discussed this with them at all.  And

 4 05:30:20   I have said that I'm not considering rev 3.

 5 05:30:23.  Sure.  And again it's my very first question, it's very

 6 05:30:28   simple.  If this tribunal were to consider that the

 7 05:30:31   rev 3 programme was deemed approved, would that change

 8 05:30:35   your analysis in a sense of taking into account the

 9 05:30:38   rev 3 programme?

10 05:30:39.  So, in that situation, my magnitudes of delays will

11 05:30:42   reduce from what I have given post August 2021 when

12 05:30:46   rev 3 programme was there, and my plan -- my critical

13 05:30:49   path will remain the same because that's the actual

14 05:30:52   critical path.  My magnitudes will get changed because

15 05:30:55   rev 3 would have given further delays to or a further

16 05:31:00   period to various sections, so that again, as I said, is

17 05:31:04   not going to be right, and probably will reduce the

18 05:31:08   critical delays which I have highlighted for windows 6,

19 05:31:12   7 and 8.

20 05:31:13.  So your analysis will no longer be accurate because it

21 05:31:18   would not take into account the rev 3 programme being

22 05:31:21   approved, so it would be a different analysis that would

23 05:31:23   be performed?

24 05:31:24.  Yes, so if rev 3 is going to be the baseline, the

25 05:31:28   magnitudes will get changed.


                                     232






 1 05:31:30.  You don't offer an analysis for that?

 2 05:31:32.  No, neither of the experts agreed on that assessment.

 3 05:31:34.  Mr Cookson has taken into account the rev 3 programme in

 4 05:31:37   his analysis.

 5 05:31:38.  No, sir, Mr Cookson has taken into consideration the

 6 05:31:40   rev 3 programme, but what he has done is, in the rev 3

 7 05:31:43   programme he has put the actual dates for phase one

 8 05:31:46   completion and accordingly reissued the rev 3 programme.

 9 05:31:52.  So he's taken into account the impact of additional

10 05:31:55   quantities which had been instructed at that time?

11 05:31:56.  No, sir, what he has done is he has created his own

12 05:31:59   programme, which is different from rev 3, in calculating

13 05:32:02   the magnitudes, which in my view is not right, because

14 05:32:05   as an expert we have to use the contemporaneous whatever

15 05:32:08   documents are there, and since rev 3 is not approved,

16 05:32:12   since rev 3 based analysis would give incorrect results

17 05:32:17   specifically from a compensation point of view, I have

18 05:32:19   not used rev 3.

19 05:32:21R GILLION:  I'm sure everyone will have his own views about

20 05:32:23   the relevance of rev 3.

21 05:32:25HE PRESIDENT:  Has the respondent any other questions to

22 05:32:27   ask arising from my questions?

23 05:32:32R ATWINE:  Yes, just one question.

24 05:32:34           Further re-examination by MR ATWINE

25 05:32:35R ATWINE:  Are you aware or do you know if the time the


                                     233






 1 05:32:39   extension that was given in rev 3, PoIT rev 3, was

 2 05:32:45   consistent with that granted in the subsequent

 3 05:32:48   administrative order which was issued in November 2022?

 4 05:32:53.  No, because the subsequent EOT which was given

 5 05:32:56   in November 2022, how will the rev 3 programme consider

 6 05:33:01   what is going to happen in November 2022?  So as I said,

 7 05:33:06   it's not correct.

 8 05:33:08R ATWINE:  Much obliged.

 9 05:33:11HE PRESIDENT:  Let me see if my fellow arbitrators ...

10 05:33:11       No.  Thank you very much indeed, Mr Singhal.

11 05:33:13   I think we will probably see you tomorrow on a different

12 05:33:15   topic, but in relation to that topic -- sorry, I do

13 05:33:21   apologise, panicked everybody there.  I apologise.

14 05:33:24   I mean the next day of the hearing.  We'll see you on

15 05:33:26   Monday.

16 05:33:27.  Right, thank you.

17 05:33:28HE PRESIDENT:  As far as I'm concerned, Mr Singhal is

18 05:33:34   released and can speak to his team because he's not in

19 05:33:37   the middle of the delay evidence and he has not started

20 05:33:39   his quantum evidence.  Is that agreed?

21 05:33:42R GILLION:  Absolutely.

22 05:33:42HE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

23 05:33:44       You probably understand, we'll have to discuss that.

24 05:33:47   Thank you very much.

25 05:33:49.  Thank you.

 2 05:33:49                       Housekeeping

 3 05:33:50HE PRESIDENT:  The tribunal is awaiting presentations from

 4 05:33:52   each of the quantum experts, which we presume we'll get

 5 05:33:55   at some point in the next 24 hours?

 6 05:33:58R GILLION:  That's correct.

 7 05:33:58HE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody for sitting

 8 05:34:00   late to see that evidence through, and in particular to

 9 05:34:03   our poor transcriber.  I hope you'll enjoy your day off

10 05:34:08   tomorrow.

11 05:34:08R GILLION:  Can I just maybe ask the tribunal whether it is

12 05:34:10   still planned to have a day or some time on Tuesday to

13 05:34:14   have the tribunal's questions to either the experts or

14 05:34:18   the parties or is it going to be in the -- or is it

15 05:34:24   going to be points that you will address maybe in

16 05:34:27   writing later on to be addressed in closing submissions?

17 05:34:29HE PRESIDENT:  That is our plan.  We have asked the

18 05:34:31   questions of the experts, as you've probably seen, as

19 05:34:34   we've gone along.  We do intend to ask the parties

20 05:34:39   questions for them to deal with in their closing

21 05:34:41   submissions, but we don't intend to suddenly launch

22 05:34:44   those at the parties to deal with on the hop on Tuesday

23 05:34:46   morning.  We will reflect on it ourselves over Tuesday

24 05:34:49   and Wednesday and issue some questions to be considered

25 05:34:52   in the closings.


                                     235






 1 05:34:54R GILLION:  So we're still planning to finish then on

 2 05:34:56   Monday close of play?

 3 05:34:57HE PRESIDENT:  We are planning -- given the progress we

 4 05:34:59   have made, we are planning -- the tribunal will continue

 5 05:35:03   to work on this on Tuesday, but we're planning to not

 6 05:35:06   see the parties on Tuesday.  We're planning firmly to

 7 05:35:10   finish proceedings in terms of the evidential gathering

 8 05:35:12   tomorrow evening.

 9 05:35:14R GILLION:  Thank you.  Monday evening.

10 05:35:15HE PRESIDENT:  Sorry, Monday evening.  And I say that

11 05:35:17   deliberately because, of course, any of the questions

12 05:35:18   which we ask the parties will not be an invite for more

13 05:35:23   evidence.  It will be asking the parties to help us on

14 05:35:25   the basis of the evidence which has been gathered.

15 05:35:31       Any other housekeeping before we finish this

16 05:35:34   evening?

17 05:35:34R KIWANUKA:  No, Mr President.

18 05:35:36HE PRESIDENT:  We look forward to seeing everybody on

19 05:35:38   Monday morning.  Thank you very much.

20 05:35:445.35 pm)
